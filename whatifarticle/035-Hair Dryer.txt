  <a href="//what-if.xkcd.com/35/"><h1>Hair Dryer</h1></a>
  <p id="question">What would happen if a hair dryer with continuous power was turned on and put in an airtight 1x1x1 meter box?</p>
<p id="attribute">—Dry Paratroopa</p>
<p>A typical hair dryer draws 1875 watts of power.</p>
<p>All 1875 watts have to go somewhere. No matter what happens inside the
box, if there’s 1875 watts of power being used, eventually there will be
1875 watts of heat flowing out.</p>
<p>This is true of any device that uses power, which is a handy thing to
know. For example, people worry about leaving disconnected chargers
plugged into the wall for fear that they’re draining power. Are they
right? You can use heat flow to come up with simple rule of thumb: If an
unused charger isn’t warm to the touch, it’s using less than a penny of
electricity a day. For a small smartphone charger, if it’s not warm to
the touch, it’s using less than a penny a <em>year</em>.</p>
<p>This is true of almost any powered device (though not necessarily those
plugged into a second device. If a charger is connected to something,
like a smartphone or laptop, power can be flowing from the wall through
the charger into the device.)</p>
<p>But back to the box.</p>
<p>Heat will flow from the hair dryer out into the box. If we assume the
dryer is indestructible, the interior of the box will keep getting
hotter until the outer surface reaches about 60°C (140°F). At that
temperature, the box will be losing heat to the outside as fast as the
hair dryer is adding it inside, and the system will be in equilibrium.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="it's warmer than my parents! it's my new parents." src="/imgs/a/35/hair_dryer_equilibrium.png">
<p>The equilibrium temperature will be a bit cooler if there’s a breeze, or
if the box is sitting on a wet or metallic surface that conducts away
heat quickly.</p>
<p>If the box is made of metal, 60°C is hot enough to <a href="http://www.mascoat.com/assets/files/Insulative_Coating_Evaluation_NACE.pdf">burn your hand if
you touch
it</a>
for more than five seconds. If it’s wood, you can probably touch it for
a while, but there’s a danger that parts of the box in contact with the
mouth of the hair dryer will catch fire.</p>
<p>The inside of a box will be like an oven. The temperature it reaches
will depend on the thickness of the box wall; the thicker and more
insulating the wall, the higher the temperature. It wouldn’t take a very
thick box to create temperatures high enough to burn out the hair dryer.</p>
<p>But let’s assume an indestructible hair dryer. And if we have something
as cool as an indestructible hair dryer, it seems like a shame to limit
it.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="anything is possible with tape" src="/imgs/a/35/hair_dryer_18750.png">
<p>With 18,750 watts flowing out of the hair dryer, the surface of the box
reaches over 200°C (475°F), as hot as a skillet on low-medium.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="new momdad is great!" src="/imgs/a/35/hair_dryer_breakfast.png">
<p>I wonder how high this dial goes.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="there's a distresing amount of space left on the dial" src="/imgs/a/35/hair_dryer_187500.png">
<p>The surface of the box is now 600°C, hot enough to glow a dim red.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="the box is glowing" src="/imgs/a/35/hair_dryer_box600.png">
<p>If it’s made of aluminium, the inside is starting to melt. If it’s made
of lead, the outside is starting to melt. If it’s on a wood floor, the
house is on fire. But it doesn't matter what's happening around it; the
hair dryer is indestructible.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="the box is glowing more" src="/imgs/a/35/hair_dryer_1875000.png">
<p>Two megawatts <a href="http://what-if.xkcd.com/13/">pumped into a laser</a> is
enough to destroy missiles.</p>
<p>At 1300°C, the box is now about the temperature of lava.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="the box is looking melty" src="/imgs/a/35/hair_dryer_box1500.png">
<p>One more notch.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="this hair dryer is probably not up to code" src="/imgs/a/35/hair_dryer_18750000.png">
<p>18 megawatts are flowing into the box.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="the box exudes a pleasant yellow glow" src="/imgs/a/35/hair_dryer_box2400.png">
<p>The surface of the box reaches 2400°C. If it were steel, it would have
melted by now. If it’s made of something like tungsten, it might
conceivably last a little longer.</p>
<p>Just one more, then we'll stop.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="the hair dryer is turned to 187 megawatts, somehow" src="/imgs/a/35/hair_dryer_187500000.png">
<p>187 megawatts is enough to make the box glow white. Not a lot of box
materials can survive these conditions, so we’ll have to assume the box
is indestructible.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="the floor is made of lava" src="/imgs/a/35/hair_dryer_box4500.png">
<p>Unfortunately, the floor isn’t.</p>
<p>Before it can burn its way through the floor, someone throws a water
balloon under it. The burst of steam launches the box out the front door
and onto the sidewalk. (Note: If you’re ever trapped with me in a
burning building, and I suggest an idea for how we could escape the
situation, it’s probably best to ignore me.)</p>
<img class="illustration" title="settings are added with reckless abandon" src="/imgs/a/35/hair_dryer_1875000000.png">
<p>1.875 gigawatts (I lied about stopping). According to <em>Back to the
Future</em>, the hair dryer is now drawing enough power to travel back in
time.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="a tiny star sits in a pool of fire" src="/imgs/a/35/hair_dryer_box8000.png">
<p>The box is blindingly bright, and you can’t get closer than a few
hundred meters due to the intense heat. It sits in the middle of a
growing pool of lava. Anything within 50-100 meters bursts into flame. A
column of heat and smoke rise high into the air. Periodic explosions of
gas beneath the box launch it into the air, and it starts fires and
forms a new lava pool where it lands.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="more settings are added via some impressively durable tape" src="/imgs/a/35/hair_dryer_18750000000.png">
<p>18.7 gigawatts. The conditions around the box are similar to those on
the pad during a Space Shuttle launch. The box begins to be tossed
around by the powerful updrafts it’s creating.</p>
<p>In 1914, H.G. Wells imagined devices like this in his book <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_Set_Free">The World
Set Free</a></em>. He wrote of
a type of bomb that, instead of exploding once, exploded <em>continuously</em>,
a slow-burn inferno that started inextinguishable fires in the hearts of
cities. The story eerily foreshadowed the development, 30 years later,
of nuclear weapons.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="hair dryers left plugged in have been known to start fires, but rarely so enthusiastically as this one" src="/imgs/a/35/hair_dryer_1e11.png">
<p>The box is now soaring through the air. Each time it nears the ground,
it superheats the surface, and the plume of expanding air hurls it back
into the sky.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="the un has expressed concern that rogue states may gain access to hair dryer power dial labeling technology" src="/imgs/a/35/hair_dryer_1e12.png">
<p>1.875 terawatts is like a house-sized stack of TNT going off <em>every
second</em>.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="we're running out of space, fortunately" src="/imgs/a/35/hair_dryer_1e13.png">
<p>A trail of firestorms—massive conflagrations which sustain themselves by
creating their own wind systems—winds its way across the landscape.</p>
<p>A new milestone: The hair dryer is now, impossibly, consuming more power
than every other electrical device on the planet combined.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="that's the last one, right?" src="/imgs/a/35/hair_dryer_1e14.png">
<p>The box, soaring high above the surface, is putting out energy
equivalent to three Trinity tests every <em>second</em>.</p>
<p>At this point, the pattern is obvious. This thing is going to skip
around the atmosphere until it destroys the planet.</p>
<p>Let's try something different.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="the dial is turned back to zero" src="/imgs/a/35/hair_dryer_0.png">
<p>We turn the dial to zero as the box is passing over northern Canada.
Rapidly cooling, it plummets to Earth, landing in Great Bear Lake with a
plume of steam. And then …</p>
<img class="illustration" title="every dial goes to 11 if you turn it hard enough" src="/imgs/a/35/hair_dryer_1e16.png">
<p>This one goes to 11. Petawatts, in this case.</p>
<p>A brief story:</p>
<p>The official record for fastest manmade object is the Helios 2 probe,
which reached about 70 km/s in a close swing around the Sun. But it’s
possible the actual holder of that title is a two-ton metal manhole
cover.</p>
<p>The cover sat atop a shaft at an underground nuclear test site operated
by Los Alamos as part of Operation Plumbbob. When the one-kiloton nuke
went off below, the facility effectively became a <a href="http://nfttu.blogspot.com/2006/01/nuclear-potato-cannon-part-2.html">nuclear potato
cannon</a>,
giving the cap a gigantic kick. A high-speed camera trained on the lid
caught only one frame of it moving upward before it vanished—which means
it was moving at a minimum of 66 km/s. The cap was never found.</p>
<p>66 km/s is about six times escape velocity, but contrary to the linked
blog’s speculation, it’s unlikely the cap ever reached space. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_depth">Newton’s
impact depth approximation</a>
suggests that it was either destroyed completely by impact with the air
or slowed and fell back to Earth.</p>
<p>Our suddenly-activated hair dryer box, bobbing in lake water, undergoes
a similar process. The heated steam below it expands outward, and as the
box rises into the air, the entire surface of the lake turns to steam.
The steam, heated to a plasma by the flood of radiation, accelerates the
box faster and faster.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="photo courtesy cmdr. hadfield" src="/imgs/a/35/hair_dryer_launch.png">
<p>Rather than slam into the atmosphere like the manhole cover, the flood
of radiation heats the air around it, creating a bubble of expanding
plasma which offers little resistance. The box exits the atmosphere and
continues away, slowly fading from second sun to dim star. Much of the
Northwest Territories is burning, but the Earth has survived.</p>
<p>Although we may wish we hadn't.</p>
