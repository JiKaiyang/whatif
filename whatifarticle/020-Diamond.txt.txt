  <p id="question">"If a meteor made out of diamond and 100 feet in diameter was traveling at the speed of light and hit the earth, what would happen to it?”</p>
<p id="attribute">—Aidan Smith, Age 8, via his father Jeff</p>
<p>Nothing made of matter can go at the speed of light. But that’s ok—we
can get close enough!</p>
<p>No matter how fast you push something, it will never quite get up to
light speed. This seems like it can’t be right, but it is. Our universe
has some weird rules. But the closer something gets to the speed of
light, the more energy and momentum it has—and this energy and momentum
go up without limit.</p>
<p>We’ll start slow and work our way up.</p>
<p><strong>1 kilometer per second:</strong></p>
<p>If we drop the meteor from the edge of space, 100 kilometers up, it’ll
punch through the atmosphere without slowing down too much and hit the
ground moving about Mach 3—over a kilometer a second.</p>
<p>As it falls, it compresses the air in front of it. When the air is
compressed, it heats it up. (This is the same thing that heats up
spacecraft and meteors—actual air <em>friction</em> has little to do with
that.) By the time it reaches the ground, the lower surface will have
heated to over 500℃, which is enough to glow visibly.</p>
<p>When it hits the ground, two minutes after it was released, it makes a
crater 300 meters across—the size of a school, shattering into fragments
in the process.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="there was a school here once" src="/imgs/a/20/diamond_1.png">
<p><strong>11 kilometers per second:</strong></p>
<p>If we set the diamond in space a little ways away from the Earth, and
let it fall toward us, it will hit at about 11 kilometers per second.
This is Earth’s escape velocity, and anything that hits the Earth from
space will—thanks to gravity—be going at least that fast.</p>
<p>At 11 kilometers per second, the brief descent would be visible as a
fireball. The energy of the impact would be comparable to a small atomic
bomb, and the crater it would create would be a kilometer across—a
little smaller than Meteor Crater in Arizona.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="FOR- MATTING" src="/imgs/a/20/diamond_11.png">
<p><strong>72 kilometers per second:</strong></p>
<p>This is just about the fastest that anything can hit the Earth if it’s
orbiting the Sun. The Leonid meteor shower hits at this speed.</p>
<p>Oddly, the speed that something is going doesn’t really affect how
deeply it digs into the ground. Isaac Newton came up with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_depth">a very clever
idea</a> for estimating how
deeply projectiles will go in their targets before stopping. It turns
out that no matter how fast a projectile is going, if it hits something
that’s about the same density, it will only go about one body-length in.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="a ball falls on the ground and then falls further into the ground but not too much further" src="/imgs/a/20/diamond_momentum.png">
<p>However, it will make quite a splash. The 72-kilometer-per-second
diamond sphere blasts out a crater over two kilometers across, with an
energy release comparable to that of the biggest fusion bombs.</p>
<p>Here’s where things get weird.</p>
<p><strong>3,000 kilometers per second = 0.01c:</strong></p>
<p>This would be pretty bad. The thing that makes this a little
unpredictable is the fact that at speeds in the range of hundreds of
kilometers per second, the air <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0032063389900305">begins to undergo nuclear
fusion</a> (Google
that paper title to find the full text). This, combined with plain old
plasma heating, may manage to eat apart the diamond sphere completely
before it reaches the ground.</p>
<p>But it doesn’t do the ground much good. The sphere doesn’t spread out
enough to make a difference, and it still hits the ground in roughly one
spot. The blast releases a thousand times more energy than the largest
nuclear weapon, devastating whatever region it came down over. It gouges
out a massive crater—though not the biggest one Earth has ever seen.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="there's a hole in south america" src="/imgs/a/20/diamond_3000.png">
<p><strong>0.99c:</strong></p>
<p>This is where relativity kicks in.</p>
<p>At these speeds, the bonds holding the sphere together are completely
irrelevant. It’s just a collection of carbon atoms moving so fast that
Lorentz contraction flattens the whole thing into a pancake (although we
<a href="http://www.math.ubc.ca/~cass/courses/m309-01a/cook/terrell1.html">wouldn’t be able to see that
visually</a>).
The <a href="http://www.srim.org/">SRIM</a> particle physics simulation tool can
help answer some questions about what happens when it hits.</p>
<p>The carbon atoms in the ball carry about 70 GeV of energy each. They’re
actually moving too fast to fuse directly with the air—they just pass
through it completely. The air molecules punch three meters into the
face of the ball before coming to a rest inside it, and it arrives at
the ground with a bunch more matter in it than it started with. It’s
also expanding rapidly.</p>
<p>When it hits the surface, it disintegrates completely, digging downward
and outward, carving a cone-shaped path down through the bedrock. The
impact depth equation no longer applies, since the atoms are literally
<em>passing through each other</em>.</p>
<p>The energy cracks a hole in the crust and blows open a crater so big you
can see the molten mantle. This delivers the energy of 50
dinosaur-killing Chicxulub impacts—enough to cause a mass extinction, if
not end life completely.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="you did this, aidan" src="/imgs/a/20/diamond_99.png">
<p>I’ve always thought that one of the the great things about physics is
that you can add more digits to <em>any number</em> and see what happens and
nobody can stop you.</p>
<p><strong>0.9999999c:</strong></p>
<p>At this speed, every carbon molecule carries 25 TeV of energy,
comparable to particles in the beam of the Large Hadron Collider. A
little faster, and we might spot Higgs bosons in the impact debris.</p>
<p>As it stands, the whole thing hits the planet with about the kinetic
energy of the orbiting Moon. It’s enough to punch a gaping hole in the
mantle and shake up the surface across the whole planet, turning it
molten. This probably ends all life on and around Earth.</p>
<p>Oops, cat stepped on my keyboard again and I added a bunch more 9s.</p>
<p><strong>0.9999999999999999999999951c</strong></p>
<p>The fastest object (with mass) in recorded history might be the
Oh-My-God particle (no relation to the God particle), a proton from
space that plowed into the atmosphere over Utah in 1991. It was moving
at 99.99999999999999999999951% of the speed of light, which meant it
packed the kinetic energy of a baseball—in a single proton. The cascade
of particles it blasted apart dwarfed anything the LHC could produce.</p>
<p>Nobody knows how it got to be moving so fast. Particles moving that fast
hit the Earth a handful of times a year. They seem to come from the
general direction of exploding galaxies, but what happened to to make
them leave in such a hurry—and why they haven’t slowed down more before
they got here—is something of a mystery.</p>
<p>Let’s give Aidan’s diamond meteor the speed of the Oh My God particle.</p>
<p>These speeds are so high that my copy of SRIM flatly refuses to simulate
them. However, we can get some idea from looking at how cosmic rays
cascade through rock.</p>
<p>The diamond sweeps out a column of atmosphere without seeming to notice
and disappears into the crust. A cloud of expanding plasma and radiation
grows around the entry point as the energy ripples outward through the
body of the planet. Forty milliseconds later the entire far side expands
outward in an incandescent cloud.</p>
<p>The diamond meteor, and the cascade of particles it created as it
collided with the crust, is spread out throughout the body of our
planet. The superheated planet glows brighter than the sun.</p>
<p>The momentum would be enough to knock the Earth into a different
orbit—but the Earth is no more. The energy deposited is ten thousand
times greater than the planet’s gravitational binding energy, and the
planet is blown into an expanding cloud of plasma, with a particularly
energetic streamer extending away from the far side of the impact site,
out into space.</p>
<p>The Sun hiccups and flares as it absorbs waves of dust. The surfaces of
Mars and Venus are scoured clean by the waves of incredibly high-energy
plasma.</p>

<p>And in the distant future, an alien astronomer on a world hundreds of
light-years from Earth frowns at a beeping detector, and wonders what
violent event would make a particle move so fast.</p>
