  <p id="question">How much would the sea level fall if every ship were removed all at once from the Earth's waters?</p>
<p id="attribute">—Michael Toje</p>
<p>About six microns—slightly more than the diameter of a strand of spider
silk.</p>

<p>Archimedes’ principle tells us that the water displaced by a ship weighs
as much as the ship itself. If we can figure out the total weight of all
the world’s ships, we can figure out how much water they’re displacing,
then divide that volume by the surface area of the ocean to figure out
how much the water level would drop.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pomorci.com/Zanimljivosti/TONNAGE%20MEASUREMENT%20OF%20SHIPS.pdf">Weighing ships is
confusing</a>.
There are a bunch of different measurements of the size of a ship, and
many of them, like gross tonnage, are actually measures of the volume of
the ship’s rooms and other internal spaces, not its weight.</p>
<p>The UN Conference on Trade and Development <a href="http://unctad.org/en/Docs/rmt2011ch2_en.pdf">publishes
estimates</a> of the size of
the world shipping fleet.</p>
<p>What the UNCTD publishes is “deadweight tonnage”, which is the maximum
weight of the ship’s fuel, cargo, and crew. What we <em>want</em> is
“displacement”. Unfortunately, comprehensive numbers for displacement
are harder to find.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we can estimate it. Brian Barrass’s book <em>Ship Design and
Performance for Masters and Mates</em> gives a table of ratios of deadweight
tonnage to displacement for different types of ships.</p>
<p>Extrapolating from the last few years of UNCTD data, and using the
coefficients from the book, suggests that the world fleet weighs about
2.15 billion tons when fully loaded. The main component of the fleet by
weight is oil tankers and bulk ore-carrying ships, which make up over
two-thirds of the total. (The UNCTD data doesn’t include small
recreational boats or naval fleets. However, based on some numbers for
<a href="http://www.csbaonline.org/4Publications/PubLibrary/R.20090217.The_US_Navy_Charti/R.20090217.The_US_Navy_Charti.pdf">naval
fleets</a> and
<a href="http://nmma.net/assets/cabinets/Cabinet445/2011_abstract_preview.pdf">recreational
boats</a>,
neither one contributes much to the total.)</p>
<p>A ton of water is about a cubic meter. 2.15 billion cubic meters divided
by the surface area of the oceans equals about 6 microns (0.006 mm).</p>
<p>But you don’t have to worry about that six-micron sea level drop. The
oceans are currently rising at about 3.3 millimeters per year due to
global warming (through both glacial melting and thermal expansion of
seawater).</p>
<p>At that rate (normalized for seasonal variation and short-term
fluctations), if you removed every ship from the ocean, the water would
be back up to its original average level in <em>16 hours</em>.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="a graph showing that you can't fix sea-level rise by putting a bunch of boats on a mountain" src="/imgs/a/33/ships_graph.png">
<p>Sea levels will likely rise <a href="">a few feet by the year 2100</a>. Current
fish wet biomass is about <a href="http://phys.org/news151251277.html">2 billion
tons</a>, so removing them won’t make a
dent either. (Marine fish biomass <a href="http://news.aaas.org/2011_annual_meeting/0228declining-fisheries.shtml">dropped by 80% over the last
century</a>,
which—taking into consideration the growth rate of the world’s shipping
fleet—leads to an odd conclusion: Sometime in the last few years, we
reached a point where there are, by weight, more ships in the ocean than
fish.)</p>
<p>And what about the old joke about how much deeper the ocean would be
without sponges? While estimates of sponge biomass are hard to come by,
the answer is probably that if you removed all the sponges, sea level
would drop by no more than a few microns ... and much less if you
squeezed them out first.</p>
