  <p id="question">What if I made a lava lamp out of real lava? What could I use as a clear medium? How close could I stand to watch it?</p>
<p id="attribute">Kathy Johnstone, 6th Grade Teacher (via a student)</p>
<p>This is a surprisingly reasonable idea, by <em>What If</em> standards.</p>
<p>I mean, it's not <em>that</em> reasonable. At the very least, I'm guessing you would lose your teaching license, and possibly some of the students in the front row. But you could do it.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="Also, I found a bunch of lava in the supply closet I needed to use up." src="/imgs/a/122/fear.png">
<p>Just a warning: I'm going to be linking to a lot of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2x7FGzjbqQ">videos</a> of lava flowing and people <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbcM7lh6DSQ">poking it with sticks</a>, so you may have a hard time getting to the end of the article without getting sidetracked into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6M-YX-r0Ll4">watching a bunch of them</a> like I did while writing it.</p>
<p>You have a few choices for transparent materials that could hold the lava without <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6pXf05Ph9Q">rupturing</a> and splattering half the classroom with red-hot droplets. Fused quartz glass would be a great choice. It's the same stuff they use in high-intensity lamp bulbs, the surface of which can easily get up to mid-range <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHO389dvj6Y">lava</a> temperatures.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[1]</span><span class="refbody"><a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Philips-400w-GY9-5-Short-Light/dp/B0062ATTRW">This bulb</a>, for example, can supposedly handle bulb temperatures of up to 1000°C, which is hotter than many types of lava.</span></span> Another possibility is sapphire, which stays solid up to 2,000°C, and is commonly used as a <a href="http://www.newport.com/Sapphire-Optical-Windows/378626/1033/info.aspx">window</a> into high-temperature chambers.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[2]</span><span class="refbody">That link wasn't a lava video, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VyKplXtOM">this</a> is.</span></span></p>

<p>The question of what to use for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scGvM_VoPwk#t=31">clear medium</a> is trickier. Let's say we find a transparent glass that melts<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[3]</span><span class="refbody">Some people say glass is a liquid that flows very slowly. Other people smugly point out that this is actually wrong. Then another group of people dissects <em>how</em> we know it's wrong, and where this incorrect idea got started. And then at the end of the chain, a Metafilter user steps back and asks some supremely insightful questions about <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/141772/MetaFolkloreFilter#5676767">what's really going on here</a> as we variously repeat and debunk these kinds of factoids.</span></span> at low temperatures. Even if we ignore the impurities from the hot lava that would probably cloud the glass, we're going to have a problem.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[4]</span><span class="refbody">And later, when the school board finds out, we'll have another.</span></span></p>
<p>Molten glass is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WmJOhbpyKY">transparent</a>. So why doesn't it <em>look</em> transparent?<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[5]</span><span class="refbody">Which sounds sorta contradictory. "This music is loud, but it doesn't <em>sound</em> loud."</span></span> The answer is simple: It glows. Hot objects give off <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QhU8eMR4IQ">blackbody radiation</a>; molten glass glows just like molten lava does, and for the same reason.</p>
<p>So the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWswq8PmRII">problem</a> with a lava lamp is that both halves of it will be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsJn8izcKtg">equally bright</a>, and it will be hard to see the lava. We could try having <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiYzYaLM-hQ">nothing</a> in the top half of the lamp—after all, when it's hot enough, lava <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFVQhcuT2U0">bubbles</a> pretty well on its own. Unfortunately, the lamp itself would <em>also</em> be in contact with the lava. Sapphire <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dww24LeoEk">might not melt</a> easily, but it <em>will</em> glow, making it hard to see whatever the lava was doing inside.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="(Artist's conception.)" src="/imgs/a/122/inside.png">
<p>Unless you hooked it up to a really bright bulb, this lava lamp would cool down quickly. Just like individual blobs of lava, the lamp would solidify and stop glowing within the first minute, and by the end of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf4wKY8PJtg">class period</a> you'd probably be able to touch it without being burned.</p>
<p>A solidified lava lamp is just about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TszHiC6fjDg">the most boring thing</a> in the world. But the scenario made me wonder: If making a lamp out of molten lava wouldn't be very exciting, then what about a volcano made of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V2_aMG3YsI">lamps</a>?</p>
<img class="illustration" title="(Realistic computer simulation of what a light bulb volcano would look like.)" src="/imgs/a/122/volcano.png">
<p>This is probably the most useless calculation I've ever done,<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[6]</span><span class="refbody">Ok, there's no <em>way</em> that's true.</span></span> but ... what if <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jxvisqt-U-8">Mount Saint Helens</a> erupted again today, but instead of tephra,<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[7]</span><span class="refbody">The technical term for "whatever crap comes out of a volcano."</span></span> it spewed compact fluorescent bulbs?</p>
<p>Well, if it did, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFvijBpzD_Y">mercury</a> released into the atmosphere would be several orders of magnitude larger than all manmade emissions combined.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[8]</span><span class="refbody"><a href="http://www.chem.unep.ch/mercury/Atmospheric_Emissions/UNEP%20SUMMARY%20REPORT%20-%20CORRECTED%20May09%20%20final%20for%20WEB%202008.pdf">45% of which</a> come from gold mining.</span></span></p>
<img class="illustration" title="I like how it's totally not clear what the rest of this claim is supposed to be. &quot;THE MORE YOU KNOW ...&quot; ... what? The happier you are? The more cultured you are? Are you better able to survive a life-or-death game of Jeopardy? If I were doing the show I would replace it with &quot;YOU JUST LEARNED THAT.&quot;" src="/imgs/a/122/more.png">
<p>All in all, I think making a lava lamp out of lava would be kind of anticlimactic, and would much rather go find some actual lava and poke it with a stick. I also think that it's probably good that Mount Saint Helens didn't erupt compact fluorescent bulbs. And I think that if I were in Ms. Johnstone's class, I'd try to sit toward the back of the room.</p>
<p>Lastly, for old time's sake, I'd like to share one final link with you: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8NXO6YxBmU#t=3">The music video for Rick Astley's "Never Gonna Give You Up."</a></p>
