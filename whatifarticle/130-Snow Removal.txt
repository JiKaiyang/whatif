  <p id="question">I've long thought about putting a flamethrower on the front of a car to melt snow and ice before you drive across it. Now I've realized that a flamethrower is impractical, but what about a high-powered microwave emitter?</p>
<p id="attribute">—Matt Van Opens</p>
<p>Believe it or not, your flamethrower idea is actually the <em>more</em> practical of the two. The flamethrower also has the advantage that, unlike the microwave, it won't interfere with wifi (unless you aim it directly at the router).</p>

<p>I'm writing this article from Boston, which is currently buried under <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/mjs538/please-stop-snowing">a truly ridiculous amount of snow</a>. We've had more snow <a href="http://weather.ou.edu/~splillo/misc.html">in the past 30 days</a> than Anchorage, Alaska usually gets in an entire winter.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[1]</span><span class="refbody">Meanwhile, Anchorage is on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/NWSBoston/status/567172928593485824">wondering</a> where their snow went and <a href="https://twitter.com/NWSAnchorage/status/567566488517619712">threatening revenge</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/EricHolthaus/status/567350490912931840">Here's</a> a neat visualization of the atmospheric pattern during these polar vortexes.

The mayor gave <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2015/02/15/boston-mayor-seems-pretty-tired-all-this-dang-snow/OYtAnLLNQ2iMBMRaxTJYzJ/story.html?s_campaign=bcom%3Asocialflow%3Atwitter">a press conference</a> in which he announced, "I don't know what to say to anybody anymore. Hopefully it will stop eventually."</p>
<p>So snow removal is on all our minds.</p>
<p>But snow is hard to melt. (And we've been <a href="https://twitter.com/NotifyBoston/status/564524089017401347">trying</a><span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[3]</span><span class="refbody">I love that tweet because it sort of sounds like it comes from an alternate fairy-tale universe where cities farm snow and snow-melters form the base of the economy.</span></span>) Your microwave idea certainly <em>sounds</em> like it should be more practical than a flamethrower. Microwaves seem clean and efficient; after all, we don't use flamethrowers in our kitchens.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="MORE LIKE GUY FIERY [FWOOOOOOSH]" src="/imgs/a/130/kitchen.png">
<p>But there's a big problem: Microwaves heat water very well, but they <a href="http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/content/kitchenscience/exp/-324719c1f8/">don't really work on ice</a>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are other ways to get energy into the ice. In addition to your flamethrower suggestion, you could, for example, use infrared heat lamps or lasers.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[4]</span><span class="refbody">Pick a frequency where snow has a low albedo; otherwise, the FBI may hunt you down for <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/why-its-terrible-idea-point-lasers-airplanes-n28841">lasering aircraft</a>.</span></span> But whatever you use, you'll run into another problem: It takes an <em>awful</em> lot of energy to melt snow.</p>
<p>Melting a gram of snow takes about 335 joules of energy. To put that another way, a 60-watt lightbulb is capable of melting about a pound of snow an hour.</p>
<p>A foot of snow contains roughly the same amount of water as an inch of rain, <a href="http://www.theweatherprediction.com/habyhints/346/">give or take</a>. Let's assume you've had a decent snowstorm of about a foot<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[5]</span><span class="refbody">For the record, by this standard, Boston has had a "decent snowstorm" every few days for the past month.</span></span>—meaning an inch worth of water—and that you want to melt a 9-foot-wide swath while driving along at 55 mph.</p>
<p>Luckily, this happens to be one of those happy physics situations where we can just multiply together every number we're looking at, and <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=55+mph+*+1+inch+*+9+feet+*+water+density+*+335+J%2Fgram">the answer</a> turns out to be the measurement we want:</p>
<p>\[55\text{ mph}\times1\text{ inch}\times9\text{ feet}\times\text{water density}\times335\tfrac{\text{J}}{\text{gram}}=574\text{ megawatts}\]</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it's not the answer we'd <em>like</em>. The nuclear reactor on an aircraft carrier, for example, produces less than 200 megawatts. To melt snow in front of your car, you'd need <em>three</em> of those.</p>

<p>What about your your original flamethrower idea?</p>
<p>Gasoline may have a phenomenally <a href="http://what-if.xkcd.com/128/">high energy density</a>, but it's not high enough. No matter how big the tank on your flamethrower was, you'd run out of fuel constantly.</p>
<p>Gas mileage in the US is often measured in "miles per gallon" of gasoline. With your flamethrower guzzling fuel, your mileage would be about 17 <em>feet</em> per gallon.</p>
<p>You might be better off dropping the flamethrower entirely. Instead, take a cue from the rail agencies, who use <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2011/01/23/mbtas_mattapan_line_relies_on_snowzilla_in_worst_weather/">jet-engine-powered snowblowers</a> to clear train tracks.</p>
<p>In the end, it's easier to just move the snow out of your way.</p>
