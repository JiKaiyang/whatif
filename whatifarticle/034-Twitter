  <p id="question">How many unique English tweets are possible? How long would it take for the population of the world to read them all out loud?</p>
<p id="attribute">—Eric H., Hopatcong, NJ</p>
<blockquote>
<p>High up in the North in the land called Svithjod, there stands a rock.
It is a hundred miles high and a hundred miles wide. Once every thousand
years a little bird comes to this rock to sharpen its beak. When the
rock has thus been worn away, then a single day of eternity will have
gone by.<br>

<p>Tweets are 140 characters long. There are 26 letters in English—27 if
you include spaces. Using that alphabet, there are \( 27^{140}
\approx 10^{200} \) possible strings.</p>
<p>But Twitter doesn't limit you to those characters. You have all of
Unicode to play with, which has room for over a million different
characters. The way Twitter counts Unicode characters <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/counting-characters">is
complicated</a>, but the
number of possible strings could be as high as \( 10^{800} \).</p>
<p>Of course, almost all of them would be meaningless jumbles of characters
from a dozen different languages. Even if you're limited to the 26
English letters, the strings would be full of meaningless jumbles like
"ptikobj". Eric's question was about tweets that actually say something
in English. How many of those are possible?</p>
<p>This is a tough question. Your first impulse might be to allow only
English words. Then you could further restrict it to grammatically valid
sentences.</p>
<p>But it gets tricky. For example, “Hi, I’m Mxyztplk” is a grammatically
valid sentence if your name happens to be Mxyztplk. (Come to think of
it, it’s just as grammatically valid if you’re lying.) Clearly, it
doesn’t make sense to count every string that starts with “Hi, I’m ...”
as a separate sentence. To a normal English speaker, “Hi, I’m Mxyztplk”
is basically indistinguishable from “Hi, I’m Mxzkqklt”, and shouldn't
both count. But “Hi, I’m xPoKeFaNx” is definitely recognizably different
from the first two, even though “xPoKeFaNx” isn’t an English word by any
stretch of the imagination.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there’s a better approach.</p>
<p>Let’s imagine a language which has only two valid sentences, and every
tweet must be one of the two sentences. They are:</p>
<ol>
<li>“There’s a horse in aisle five.”</li>
<li>“My house is full of traps.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Twitter would look like this:</p>
<img class="illustration" title="i once knew a little internet community that repeated the same six lines of conversation, in the same order, for over ten years, while having their actual conversation in their posts' title lines" src="/imgs/a/34/twitter_screenshot.png">
<p>The messages are relatively long, but there’s not a lot of information
in each one—all they tell you is whether the person decided to send the
trap message or the horse message. It’s a 1 or a 0. Although there are a
lot of letters, for a reader who knows the pattern the language carries
only one <em>bit</em> of information per sentence.</p>
<p>This example hints at a very deep idea, which is that information is
fundamentally tied to the recipient’s uncertainty about the message’s
content and their ability to predict it in advance.</p>
<p>Claude Shannon—who almost singlehandedly
<a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/what/shannonday/shannon1948.pdf">invented</a> modern
information theory—had a clever method for measuring the information
content of a language. He showed groups of people samples of typical
written English which were cut off at a random point, then asked them to
guess which letter came next.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="a volcano threatens to flood a town with information" src="/imgs/a/34/twitter_volcano.png">
<p>Based on the rates of correct guesses—and <a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Shannon1950.pdf">rigorous mathematical
analysis</a>—Shannon
determined that the information content of typical written English was
around 1.0 to 1.2 bits per letter. This means that a good compression
algorithm should be able to compress ASCII English text—which is eight
bits per letter—to about 1/8th of its original size. Indeed, if you use
a good file compressor on a .txt ebook, that’s about what you’ll find.</p>
<p>If a piece of text contains <em><strong>n</strong></em> bits of information, in a sense it
means that there are \( 2^n \) different messages it can convey.
There’s a bit of mathematical juggling here (involving, among other
things, the length of the message and the concept of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicity_distance">unicity
distance</a>), but the
bottom line is that it suggests there are on the order of about \(
2^{140\times1.1} \approx 2\times10^{46} \) meaningfully different
English tweets, rather than \( 10^{200} \) or \( 10^{800} \).</p>
<p>Now, how long would it take the world to read them all out?</p>
<p>Reading \( 2\times10^{46} \) tweets would take a person nearly \(
10^{47} \) seconds. It’s such a staggeringly large number of tweets
that it hardly matters whether it’s one person reading or a billion—they
won’t be able to make a meaningful dent in the list in the lifetime of
the Earth.</p>
<p>Instead, let’s think back to that bird sharpening its beak on the
mountaintop. Suppose that the bird scrapes off a tiny bit of rock from
the mountain when it visits every thousand years, and it carries away
those few dozen dust particles when it leaves. (A normal bird would
probably <em>deposit</em> more beak material on the mountaintop than it would
wear away, but virtually nothing else about this scenario is normal
either, so we’ll just go with it.)</p>
<p>Let’s say you read tweets aloud for 16 hours a day, every day. And
behind you, every thousand years, the bird arrives and scrapes off a few
invisible specks of dust from the top of the hundred-mile mountain with
its beak.</p>
<p>When the mountain is worn flat to the ground, that’s the first day of
eternity.</p>
<p>The mountain reappears and the cycle starts again for another eternal
day. 365 eternal days—each one \( 10^{32} \) years long—makes an
eternal year.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="years go by so quickly" src="/imgs/a/34/twitter_mountains.png">
<p>100 eternal years, in which the bird grinds away 36,500 mountains, make
an eternal century.</p>
<p>But a century isn’t enough. Nor a millennium.</p>
<p>Reading all the tweets takes you <em>ten</em> <em>thousand</em> eternal years.</p>
<p>That’s enough time to watch all of human history unfold, from the
invention of writing to the present, with each day lasting as long as it
takes for the bird to wear down a mountain.</p>
<p>140 characters may not seem like a lot, but we will <em>never</em> run out of
things to say.</p>
