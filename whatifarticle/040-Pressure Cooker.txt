  <p id="question">Am I right to be afraid of pressure cookers? What's the worst thing that can happen if you misuse a pressure cooker in an ordinary kitchen?</p>

<p>The <em>worst</em> thing?</p>

<p>Pressure cookers are dangerous.</p>
<p>They can explode, in a sense, but not as violently as you might fear (or
hope). The pressure inside a consumer cooker doesn’t go above about two
atmospheres—about the pressure <a href="http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2000/SeemaMeraj.shtml">inside a can of
soda</a>. Those
levels can be dangerous, but they’re generally not high enough to cause
the metal to violently rupture.</p>
<p>So what makes a pressure cooker dangerous?</p>
<p>Imagine a world where Pepsi is scalding hot. Now imagine that someone
shakes up a can of Pepsi and sets it in front of you.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="the first thing i’d do in this world is try the diet coke and mentos thing" src="/imgs/a/40/pressure_cooker_pepsi.png">
<p>That’s the real threat from a pressure cooker: If the seal fails (or the
lid is opened too early), it can <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/12670995@N02/1888382766/">spray scalding stew in all
directions</a>.</p>
<p>But it’s not really an <em>explosion</em>.</p>
<p>The blast couldn’t even fling the lid very far. If you mounted a
rifle-style barrel on a pressure cooker, even in ideal circumstances it
wouldn’t be able to fire the lid much faster than you could throw it.
Any potato cannon (especially <a href="http://www.spudfiles.com/forums/mk-2-rotary-barrel-semi-automatic-combustion-t15766.html">this
one</a>)
could do better.</p>
<p>Of course, the question wasn’t about whether a pressure cooker is likely
to explode. It was about what the worst thing that could happen was.</p>
<p>If you disable the safety valve, there are plenty of ways to produce
much more dangerous pressures. You could completely fill it with water
and heat it, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbaiCdX1XWc">fill it with Drano and aluminum
foil</a>, or just pump in air
from a compressor.</p>
<p>The result would depend on your pressure cooker. Chances are it would
start to leak. If it didn’t, and it somehow stayed together up a few
hundred atmospheres (pressures typical of scuba tank), when it finally
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyINNUaXa8Q">ruptured</a> it could easily
kill you.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="frankly, we're surprised she survived this long" src="/imgs/a/40/pressure_cooker_grave.png">
<p>Even so, that’s far from the <em>worst</em> thing you could do with a pressure
cooker.</p>
<p>Frankly, there are so many options it would be impossible to survey them
all. But for my money, one of the most horrifying things you could do is
this:</p>
<p><em>(Note: <strong>Never</strong> try this, for reasons which will become obvious in
a moment.)</em></p>
<p>Fill the cooker with oxygen up to 5 PSI, then pump in fluorine until it
starts escaping through the safety valve. Put the vessel over an open
flame until it reaches 700°C (That’s °C, not °F. Yes, this will probably
set off the smoke alarm.) Now, pump the hot gas over a
liquid-oxygen-cooled stainless steel surface.</p>
<p>The procedure here is a little tricky, but if you do things
<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022113900803413">right</a>,
the gas will condense into <strong>dioxygen difluoride</strong> (O2F2).</p>
<p>And that stuff is <em>awful</em>.</p>
<p>Ray Bradbury <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit_451">taught
us</a> that paper burns when
exposed to oxygen at temperatures above 451°F. Dioxygen difluoride is so
volatile that it makes almost any organic substance ignite and explode
at any temperature hotter than 300°F <em>below zero.</em> It can literally make
<em><strong>ice</strong></em> catch fire.</p>
<p><a href="http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2010/02/23/things_i_wont_work_with_dioxygen_difluoride.php">In an article about

Chemistry blogger Derek Lowe (of the excellent <em>In The Pipeline</em>) used
phrases like “violently hideous”, “deeply alarming”, and “chemicals that
I never hope to encounter”. <a href="http://www.lateralscience.co.uk/Fluorine/Fluorine.html">Another
article</a> refers
to fluorine as “the gas of Lucifer”, and lists chemists who were
poisoned or blown up while attempting to work with it.</p>
<p>If your house is heated by natural gas, and it happens to contain
hydrogen sulfide, you could pipe some of it into your container of O2F2.
In addition to a massive explosion, this will <em>also</em> produce a cloud of
hydrogen fluoride gas. Hydrogen fluoride can dissolve human tissue on
contact, starting with your lungs and corneas.</p>
<p>As Lowe points out, the chemistry of this kind of reaction (O2F2 and
sulfides) is largely unexplored.</p>
<p>Which gives us an answer to our question. What’s the worst thing that
can happen in a pressure cooker?</p>
