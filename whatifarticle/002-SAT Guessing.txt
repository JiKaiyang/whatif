  <p id="question">What if everyone who took the SAT guessed on every multiple-choice question? How many perfect scores would there be?</p>

<p>None.</p>
<p>The SAT is a standardized test given to high school students (similar to
the ACT). The scoring is such that under certain circumstances, guessing
an answer can be a good strategy. But what if you guessed on everything?</p>
<p>Not all of the SAT is multiple-choice, so let’s focus on the multiple
choice questions to keep things simple. We’ll assume everyone gets the
essay questions and fill-in-the-number sections correct.</p>
<p>There are 44 multiple-choice questions in the math (quantitative)
section, 67 in the critical reading (qualitative) section, and 47 in the
newfangled writing section. Each question has five options, so a random
guess has a 20% chance of being right:</p>

<p>Although we all know the answer is always B.</p>
<p>The probability of getting all 158 questions is: \[\frac{1}{5^{44}}
* \frac{1}{5^{67}} * \frac{1}{5^{47}} \approx \frac{1}{2.7 *
10^{110}}\]</p>
<p>(That's one in twenty-seven quinquatrigintillion.)</p>
<p>If all four million 17-year-olds all took the SAT, and they all guessed
randomly, it’s a statistical certainty that there would be no perfect
scores on any of the three sections.</p>
<p>How certain is it? Well, if they each used a computer to take the test a
million times each day, and continued this every day for five billion
years—until the Sun expanded to a red giant and the Earth was charred to
a cinder—the chance of any of them ever getting a perfect score on <em>just
the math section</em> would be about 0.0001%.</p>
<p>How unlikely is that? Each year something like 500 Americans are struck
by
lightning<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[1]</span><span class="refbody">Cooper, Mary Ann, MD. <a href="http://www.uic.edu/labs/lightninginjury/Disability.pdf">"Disability, Not Death is the Main Problem with Lightning Injury"</a></span></span><span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[2]</span><span class="refbody"><a href="http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/hazstats/light08.pdf"></a><a href="http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/hazstats/light08.pdf">http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/hazstats/light08.pdf</a></span></span>
(based on an average of 45 lightning deaths and a 9-10% fatality rate).
This suggests that the odds of any one American being hit in a given
year are about one in in 700,000 (although probability can be
<a href="http://xkcd.com/795/">tricky</a>).</p>
<p>This means that the odds of acing the SAT by guessing are worse than the
odds of every living ex-President and every member of the main cast of
Firefly all being independently struck by lightning … <em>on the same day</em>.</p>

<p>(Everyone survives but Alan Tudyk and Ron Glass)</p>
<p>To everyone taking the SAT this year, good luck—but it won’t be enough.</p>
