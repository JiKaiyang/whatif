  <p id="question">When - if ever - will the bandwidth of the Internet surpass that of FedEx?</p>

<p>If you want to transfer a few hundred gigabytes of data, it’s generally
faster to FedEx a hard drive than to send the files over the internet.
This isn’t a new idea—it’s often dubbed SneakerNet—and it’s how Google
<a href="http://royal.pingdom.com/2007/04/11/fedex-still-faster-than-the-internet/">transfers large amounts of data
internally</a>.</p>
<p>But will it always be faster?</p>
<p>Cisco
<a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/solutions/collateral/ns341/ns525/ns537/ns705/ns827/white_paper_c11-481360_ns827_Networking_Solutions_White_Paper.html">estimates</a> that
total internet traffic currently averages 167 terabits per second. FedEx
has a fleet of 654 aircraft with a <a href="http://www.fedex.com/sv_english/about/facts.html">lift capacity of 26.5 million pounds
daily</a>. A solid-state
laptop drive weighs <a href="http://download.intel.com/newsroom/kits/ssd/pdfs/intel_ssd_520_product_spec_325968.pdf">about 78
grams</a> and
can hold up to a terabyte.</p>
<p>That means FedEx is capable of transferring 150 exabytes of data per
day, or 14 petabits per second—almost a hundred times the current
throughput of the internet.</p>

<p><em>If you don’t care about cost, this ten-kilogram shoebox can hold a lot
of internet</em></p>
<p>We can improve the data density even further by using MicroSD cards:</p>
<img class="illustration" title="glug glug glug glug" src="/imgs/a/31/fedex_milk.png">
<p>Those thumbnail-sized flakes have a storage density of up to 160
terabytes per kilogram, which means a FedEx fleet loaded with MicroSD
cards could transfer about 177 petabits per second, or two zettabytes
per day—a thousand times the internet’s current traffic level. (The
infrastructure would be interesting—Google would need to build huge
warehouses to hold <a href="http://nuclearsecrecy.com/blog/2011/11/10/weekly-document-01/">a massive card-processing
operation</a>.)</p>
<p>Cisco estimates internet traffic is growing at about 29% annually. At
that rate, we’d hit the FedEx point in 2040. Of course, the amount of
data we can fit on a drive will have gone up by then, too. The only way
to actually reach the FedEx point is if transfer rates grow much faster
than storage rates. In an intuitive sense, this seems unlikely, since
storage and transfer are fundamentally linked—all that data is coming
from somewhere and going somewhere—but there’s no way to  predict usage
patterns for sure.</p>
<p>While FedEx is big enough to keep up with the next few decades of actual
usage, there’s no technological reason we can’t build a connection that
beats them on bandwidth. There are experimental fiber clusters that can
<a href="http://optics.org/news/4/1/29">handle over a petabit per second</a>. A
cluster of 200 of those would beat FedEx.</p>
<p>If you recruited the entire <a href="http://www.cargotransporters.com/pdf/dyk201001.pdf">US freight
industry</a> to move SD
cards for you, the throughput would be on the order of 500 exabits—half
a zettabit—per second. To match that transfer rate digitally, you’d need
take half a million of those petabit cables.</p>
<p>So the bottom line is that for raw bandwidth, the internet will probably
never beat SneakerNet. Of course, the virtually infinite bandwidth would
come at the cost of 80,000,000-millisecond ping times.</p>
