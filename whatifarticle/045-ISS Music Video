  <p id="question">Is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaOC9danxNo">this</a> the most expensive music video ever?</p>
<p id="attribute">—Various Youtube commenters</p>
<p>For starters, a big welcome home to Chris Hadfield, who returned to
Earth last night after a memorable stint as commander of the
International Space Station.</p>
<p>Commander Hadfield’s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaOC9danxNo">video performance of Space
Oddity</a> was an instant hit,
and prompted many commenters to ask whether it should count as the most
expensive music video ever made.</p>
<p>At a total lifetime cost in the neighborhood of \$150 billion
<sup><a href="http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1579/1">[1]</a></sup>, the International
Space Station is one of the world’s most expensive megaprojects. (The
exact cost is hard to pin down, since the countries contributing don’t
all handle their finances the same way.)</p>
<p>By comparison, the most expensive music videos have production budgets
in the range of a few million dollars. If Commander Hadfield’s video
gets the ISS’s entire \$150 billion price tag, then it must be tens of
thousands of times more expensive than the runner-up, right?</p>
<p>Not so fast.</p>
<p>The ISS is expensive, but there have been music videos set against an
even <em>more</em> expensive backdrop.</p>
<p>At a cost of roughly \$400 billion, the US Eisenhower Interstate
Highway System is probably the most expensive peacetime public works
project in the history of mankind. If we’re including the entire ISS in
the cost of Commander Hadfield’s video, any video shot on the American
highway system should get the cost of the highway system added to its
total.</p>
<p>By that measure, the commander’s video would lose to U2’s <em>Last Night on
Earth</em>, which was filmed on a section of I-670 in
Missouri,<sup><a href="http://www.atu2.com/news/filming-of-music-video-will-shut-down-i-670-downtown-for-several-hours-tuesday.html">[2]</a></sup> and
therefore cost more than the ISS and the Moon landing program
<em>combined.</em></p>
<p>In both cases, the comparison doesn’t really make sense; both the ISS
and the US highway system are used for things other than making music
videos.<sup>[<span style="color:#0645ad; font-style:italic; font-weight: bold;font-family: sans-serif;">citation needed</span>]</sup> Instead,
let’s look at some other ways we could calculate the cost of Hadfield’s
video.</p>
<p>If you spread out the ISS’s price tag across all the astronaut-hours
spent on board, you come up with about \$7.5 million per person per
day, or roughly \$90 per
second.<sup><a href="http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1579/1">[3]</a></sup> That sounds
like a lot, but at that rate, the five-and-a-half-minute video only runs
about \$30,000. Given that the video has probably done more for space
industry than millions in public outreach, that’s a good deal.</p>
<p>Hadfield’s son confirmed that Hadfield shot the video himself with no
help from other astronauts, so even if we assume he spent several hours
setting it up and recording it, we don’t come close to the \$7 million
cost of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0P4A1K4lXDo">the video</a> Michael
and Janet Jackson made for <em>Scream</em>.</p>
<p>And the truth is, this isn’t a very good way to calculate costs either.
Presumably, Commander Hadfield isn’t busy commanding things 24/7. He has
some free time, and it’s no skin off anyone’s back how he spends it
(assuming his hobby isn’t drilling holes in walls). It’s hard to argue
that shooting the video cost anyone \$90/second when he was going to
be up there floating around anyway.</p>

<p>Alternately, we could look at how much Commander Hadfield was <em>paid</em> to
make the video. As a Canadian astronaut, his salary is somewhere between
\$145,200 and \$171,000
CAD.<sup><a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2013/05/12/hadfield-iss-returns-earth.html">[4]</a></sup> Astronaut
work hours are a little atypical, but if we assume that in the long run
he’s on the job 40 hours a week, that works out to \$85/hour. By that
measure, the cost of the video was \$7.84. Not 7.84 million; 7 dollars
and 84 cents (\$7.76 US).</p>
<img class="illustration" title="UNSCHEDULED BURN" src="/imgs/a/45/hadfield_spotify.png">
<p>And then there’s the guitar.</p>
<p>While it’s hard to argue that the entire cost of the ISS counts toward
the video, we could at least include the cost to launch the guitar. The
Larrivée Parlor acoustic guitar in the video went up years ago on the
Space Shuttle, and astronauts have been playing it ever
since.<sup><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWTndmDHZQc">[5]</a></sup> Given that
launch costs at the time were between \$20,000 and \$30,000 per
pound, the cost to send up the guitar was probably in the neighborhood
of \$75,000.</p>
<p>While that’s far from the most anyone’s paid for a
guitar,<sup><a href="http://www.fender.com/news/signed-strat-fetches-record-28m-at-auction/">[6]</a></sup> it’s
certainly a lot of money. And if playing music helps the astronauts
relax and keep from going crazy while they’re crammed together in a tin
can for months at a time, it’s probably a worthwhile investment.</p>
<p>Of course, this plan could backfire.</p>
