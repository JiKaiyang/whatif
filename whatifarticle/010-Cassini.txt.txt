  <p id="question">What would the world be like if the land masses were spread out the same way as now - only rotated by an angle of 90 degrees?</p>
<p id="attribute">—Socke</p>
<p>It would profoundly alter our biosphere in general and public radio in
particular.</p>
<p>Socke asks what would happen if the Earth’s surface were slid around by
90 degrees, putting our current North and South Poles on the equator.
We’re not changing the tilt of the Earth’s axis; we’re just imagining
that the surface were arranged differently.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="a diagram showing the new location of the equator and the poles" src="/imgs/a/10/cassini_flip.png">
<p>We’ll pick the Greenwich meridian for our new equator, putting the new
North and South poles in the Indian ocean (0N, 90E) and off the coast of
Ecuador (0N, 90W). India, Indonesia, and Ecuador would become polar,
while Europe, Antarctica, and Alaska would become tropical.</p>
<p>Where would the deserts and forests be? What areas would get better or
worse?</p>
<p>This stuff is complicated. In a moment, we'll start using wild
speculation to reshape the face of the planet. But first, a brief story
to illustrate just how mind-bogglingly complicated this stuff is:</p>
<p>In Chad, on the southern outskirts of the Sahara, there’s valley called
the Bodélé Depression. It was once a lakebed, and the dry dust in the
valley floor is full of nutrient-rich matter from the microorganisms
that lived there.</p>
<p>From October to March, winds coming in from the east are pinched between
two mountain ranges. When the surface winds climb over 20 mph, they
start picking up dust from the valley. This dust is blown westward, all
the way across Africa, and out over the Atlantic.</p>
<p>That dirt—from one small valley in Chad—<a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/1/1/014005">supplies over 50% of the
nutrient-rich dust that helps fertilize the Amazon
rainforest</a>.</p>
<p>At least, according to that one study. But if it's right, it wouldn’t be
a crazy anomaly. This kind of complexity is found <em>everywhere</em>. The
basic building blocks of our world are <em>crazy</em>.</p>
<p>This is why we can be so certain about large-scale patterns like global
warming, where we understand the overall physics pretty well—energy
comes in, less energy goes out, so the average temperature rises—but
have a harder time predicting how it will affect any particular place or
specific species.</p>
<p>So even if I were a climate expert—which I’m definitely not—there’d be
no way to answer this question with certainty. There are just too many
variables. Instead, think of what follows as a rough sketch of some of
the things this alternate Earth could contain.</p>
<p>To start, here’s a map of our reshuffled world:</p>
<img class="illustration" title="a map of the reshuffled earth, with asia, africa, and most of antarctica north of the equator and north and south america south of it." src="/imgs/a/10/cassini_blank.png">
<p>(An equirectangular projection, by the way. This type of equirectangular
projection, centered on a north-south meridian instead of the equator,
is specifically called a Cassini projection, so a good name for our
alternate Earth might be "Cassini".)</p>
<p>Let’s imagine that this alternate Earth develops over millions of years,
with ecosystems and climate zones settling out. Then one day we wake up
to find our current civilization has been magically transported
there—cities and all. What would they find?</p>
<p>The climate on the rotated Earth would depend heavily on the details of
<a href="http://eesc.columbia.edu/courses/ees/climate/lectures/gen_circ/index.html">ocean and atmospheric heat
circulation</a>.
We'll guess at some of that, but for now, let's assume this world has
extremes which are similar to ours.</p>
<p>So let's add some ice and permafrost near the poles and in mountainous
areas:</p>
<img class="illustration" title="a map showing ice near the poles and mountainouse areas, shown with a light blue color" src="/imgs/a/10/cassini_ice.png">
<p>Next, we should fill in some green areas and deserts. The locations of
these depend heavily on rainfall, so we’ll need to sketch out some
winds.</p>
<p>The main driver of our weather is the sun, which heats air near the
equator more than at the poles. Hot air rises at the equator and then
flows poleward, and cooler air moves in across the surface toward the
equator. This circulation is called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadley_cell">Hadley
cell</a>.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="illustration of a hadley cell" src="/imgs/a/10/cassini_hadley.png">
<p>Hadley cells shift north and south of the Equator with the seasons. At
this time of year on our Earth, the sun is directly overhead at about
10°N, which is why hurricanes are forming near that latitude right now.</p>
<p>Because of the Coriolis effect, the surface winds in a Hadley cell flow
from east to west. Further north, for most of the temperate zones, the
prevailing surface winds are west to east. (At times, there are also
east-to-west winds circulating around the poles.)</p>
<p>So let’s fill in some wind patterns—keeping in mind that in reality
things would be further complicated by land interactions and the
location of persistent high and low pressure systems.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="a map with the new wind patterns" src="/imgs/a/10/cassini_tradewinds.png">
<p>Sinking air is cool and dry, so land under the outer edges of the Hadley
cells tends to be arid. These regions, lying a bit poleward of 30
degrees, are known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_latitudes">horse
latitudes</a>.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="map showing air movement with horse latitudes labeled" src="/imgs/a/10/cassini_horse.png">
<p>The rising air at the equator carries moisture from the ocean, which
then condenses into rain, so tropical areas are usually wet and thick
with growth. Areas near the equator are sometimes dominated by a
seasonal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon">monsoon cycle</a>.</p>
<p>In temperate zones, things are more variable. Weather there is dominated
by the movement of jet streams and fronts, and depends heavily on
geography. Most of the United States is in this type of region.</p>
<p>With all that in mind, let’s fill in some arid and lush areas:</p>
<img class="illustration" title="the same map filled in with various lush (green) and arid (yellow) areas" src="/imgs/a/10/cassini_climate.png">
<p>(Climates can be hard to predict—for example, in our world, Somalia and
French Guiana both sit on the equator, at the eastern coast of a
continent, and seem like they should both receive a tropical sea breeze.
But coastal French Guiana is dense rain forest while coastal Somalia is
an arid desert. The explanation involves the monsoon cycle.)</p>
<p>And just for fun, here’s a wild guess as to where the hurricane basins
would be:</p>
<img class="illustration" title="the same map with swaths of red to show where hurricanes might occur" src="/imgs/a/10/cassini_hurricanes.png">
<p>Let’s take a closer look at each continent.</p>
<p><strong>North America</strong> has a range of climates similar to what it had before,
but flipped north-south. The Arctic Canadian provinces are now tropical,
while Central America is icy and polar. Hurricanes threaten Greenland,
Baffin Island, and the Maritimes. Tropical moisture from Baffin Bay and
the northwest (formerly north) Atlantic mixes with cool air flowing down
through the US from the Rockies, creating a new Tornado Alley in the
prairies inland from Hudson Bay.</p>
<p><strong>South America</strong> looks sort of like the old Europe. It's cool and
temperate along the Brazilian coast, with boreal forests and grasslands
across much of its width. In the south, the boreal vegetation gives way
to polar tundra, and eventually to the massive icebound Andes, which cut
the continent off from the frozen polar waters. The Amazon, which in our
world carries more water than the next seven largest rivers put
together, is reduced to something akin to the Mississippi.</p>
<p><strong>Asia</strong> is flipped in the same way North America was, with the Siberian
coast facing an enclosed tropical sea. The Indian subcontinent and north
(formerly southeast) Asia form the new Siberia. The Gobi Desert is no
longer in the rain shadow of the Himalayas, but doesn't exactly become
tropical.</p>
<p><strong>Europe</strong> resembles the old southeast Asia. Great Britain and Ireland
look like the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Borneo. Iceland
resembles our Philippines. Central Europe is the new New Guinea, with
the Alps the only place on the Equator with permanent glaciers.</p>
<p><strong>Africa</strong> is rotated 90 degrees, with south (formerly west) Africa
becoming tropical rainforest and north (formerly east) Africa an arid
desert. On our Earth, North America is the only continent where
tornadoes are common, but in this world, they're frequent in East Africa
as well.</p>
<p><strong>Australia</strong> is cooler and wetter, with forests across the northern
(formerly western) regions.</p>
<p><strong>Antarctica</strong> is a clear winner. Without its ice cap, it’s a bit
smaller than we remember, but most of it is blanketed with highland
rainforest. There are alpine zones around the mountains to the south and
west. The researchers at McMurdo and Scott Base on Ross Island wake up
to a tropical paradise. If any of them find they miss the frozen
wastelands, they can always put in for a transfer to Costa Rica.</p>
<p>Now, let’s see how the world’s largest cities fare:</p>
<img class="illustration" title="the same map showing where some maor cities would now be located" src="/imgs/a/10/cassini_cities.png">
<p>Some cities get colder.</p>
<p><strong>Mexico City,</strong> high in the polar mountains, is buried beneath an ice
sheet.</p>
<p><strong>Jakarta</strong> is the new Svalbard—a desolate coastal rock too far north
even for most Norwegians.</p>
<p><strong>Kolkata</strong> and <strong>Delhi</strong> are icebound, sealed off from the warmer world
by the Himalayas.</p>
<p><strong>Hong Kong</strong>, <strong>Manila</strong>, <strong>Karachi</strong>, and <strong>Mumbai</strong> are similar to
our world’s Anchorage or Reykjavik—the ocean isn’t frozen, but it sure
is cold.</p>
<p>A few cities remain perfectly habitable, albeit with some changes:</p>
<p><strong>Seoul</strong>, <strong>Osaka</strong>, <strong>Tokyo</strong>, <strong>Shanghai,</strong> and <strong>New York City</strong> are
among the least-affected cities, with climates roughly similar to their
previous ones. Shanghai does get colder, but seasonal extremes in all
five cities get milder—particularly in Seoul—and substantially wetter.</p>
<p><strong>Cairo</strong> is moved slightly south. It’s now surrounded by coastal
savannah, with spots of rain forest found around the mouth of the Nile.
Though it moves closer to the equator, it doesn’t actually get hotter.</p>
<p><strong>São Paulo</strong> and <strong>Buenos Aires</strong> cool down a bit. They’re now on the
northern coast of a South America, which occupies a Canadalike range of
latitudes. Their climate is somewhere between that of our New England
and that of our Regular England.</p>
<p><strong>Los Angeles</strong> is cool and mild. The steady sea breeze carrying
moisture up into the San Gabriel mountains makes LA one of the rainiest
places in the new US. It closely resembles a wetter version of our
Seattle.</p>
<p>And a few cities get much hotter.</p>
<p><strong>Moscow</strong> is extremely hot and very dry, with a climate somewhere
between our Phoenix and our Baghdad. Russians, who have been surviving
in Russia for centuries, shrug with resignation.</p>
<p><strong>London</strong> sits in a steamy jungle straddling the equator, with a
climate generally resembling Manila's. The food is still bland, the
Thames is full of piranha, and it's the only place on Earth where tigers
apologize as they attack you.</p>
<p>At the beginning, I mentioned the impact on public radio. To explain,
let’s consider one more scenario. Namely, what if this change were made
on <em>our</em> Earth, over a fairly short time?</p>
<p>We’re assuming that all the material is magically shifted around, so
there are no massive tsunamis or earthquakes. Even so, it would
definitely still be a catastrophe. For starters, the ice caps would melt
long before new ones could develop, pushing the ocean up by a few
hundred feet. The reshuffling of climate zones would come as a huge
shock to the biosphere, leading to collapse of the food chain and
eventually to mass extinctions at every level.</p>
<p>But if the shift happened just right—and Michael Bay were telling the
story—then as the waters of the Gulf of Mexico began to cool and the
Mississippi slowed and became an estuary, the region’s wildlife would
spread inland.</p>
<p>And one morning, Minnesotans would wake up to the sight of floating
<a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/04/pictures/110425-fire-ants-life-rafts-swarms-science-proceedings/">rafts of fire
ants</a>,
followed by five million lost, hungry alligators …</p>
