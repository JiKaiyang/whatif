  <p id="question">Every now and then we have to insert a leap second because the Earth’s rotation is slowing down. Could we speed up Earth’s rotation, so that we do not need Leap Seconds?</p>
<p id="attribute">—Anton (Berlin, Germany)</p>
<p>The Earth’s spin is slowing down. This is annoying.</p>
<p>One reason that it’s annoying is that it makes time standards more
difficult. We already have <a href="http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/systime.html">way too many time
standards</a>, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TAI</strong>, time based on an atomic clock, which ignores all motion of
the Earth</li>
<li><strong>UT0</strong> and <strong>UT1</strong>, time based on precise measurement of the
Earth’s rotation</li>
<li><strong>GPS</strong>, the time standard used by GPS satellites</li>
<li><strong>UTC</strong>, the standard used in computing, which is like <strong>TAI</strong> but
with leap seconds to keep it in sync with Earth</li>
<li><strong>TDT</strong>, <strong>TBT</strong>, <strong>TCB</strong>, and<strong> TCG</strong>,<strong> </strong>which are all even worse</li>
</ul>
<p>This leads to all kinds of little headaches, particularly for
programmers. For example, the clock in your smartphone’s GPS is 16
seconds out of sync with the phone’s system clock. This is because the
system clock uses Coordinated Universal Time (which has leap seconds),
but GPS time doesn’t. They were in sync in January of 1980 and probably
never will be again.</p>
<p>Half a billion years ago (when the Earth was 4 billion years old,
instead of 4.5), each day was 22 hours long instead of 24. The day has
gotten longer because of tidal forces from the Moon.</p>
<p>Loosely speaking, here’s how tidal drag works: The Moon’s tides raise
bulges in the Earth, but the Earth’s rotation moves those bulges out of
line with the Moon. The Moon’s gravity tries to tug the bulges back into
line, which exerts a twisting force on the Earth, slowing it down:</p>
<img class="illustration" title="a picture explaining tidal drag that is wrong in almost every specific way but right in general" src="/imgs/a/26/leap_tides.png">
<p>Strangely, the Earth is actually not slowing down as much as you’d
expect from tidal drag. The biggest reason for the discrepancy is that
during the last ice age, the continents were pushed down by the weight
of the glaciers, and they’re still springing back into place. This has
the effect of shifting mass toward the poles, closer to the axis of
rotation:</p>
<img class="illustration" title="the earth springs back into shape" src="/imgs/a/26/leap_mass_shift.png">
<p>This makes us spin faster—or, at least, keeps us from slowing down as
quickly.</p>
<p>At the moment, each day is about 0.8 milliseconds longer than the 86,400
seconds it needs to be to avoid adding leap seconds.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="a graph documenting the war between timekeepers and time" src="/imgs/a/26/leap_graph.png">
<p>This difference fluctuates over time based on weather and other effects
(it’s actually shortened a bit since the early 1990s), although in the
long run, it will definitely get larger as the Earth slows.</p>
<p>If we wanted to get rid of leap seconds, we’d need to keep the Earth
spinning at a more constant rate. This means speeding up the Earth and
shortening each day by about 0.8 milliseconds.</p>
<p>This is a tough problem. Here are a few things that won’t work:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://xkcd.com/162/">Spinning counterclockwise</a></strong><strong> in a chair</strong>. It
temporarily alters the Earth’s rate of rotation, but not enough to
matter.</p>
<p><strong>Putting rocket engines on the Equator.</strong> This won’t work because the
exhaust would go into the atmosphere, which transmits the force back to
the ground as wind drag—it’d be like making a bike go forward by pushing
on the handlebars. If the engines were somehow mounted above the
atmosphere, they’d be able to slow the Earth, but not by enough to
accomplish our goal.</p>
<p><strong>Triggering big earthquakes.</strong> This can <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/japanquake/earth20110314.html">alter the length of the
day</a>,
but even those aren’t big enough to make a difference.</p>
<p>In the end, there’s only one solution: Hitting the Earth with asteroids.</p>
<p>Given enough time, we could send a spaceship (captained by an anti-Bruce
Willis) to perform repeated flybys of a comet. Over time, the
gravitational perturbation could steer the comet into a collision course
with Earth. By hitting the Earth at the right angle, we would give it a
push:</p>
<img class="illustration" title="a meteor hits the earth to fix the problems" src="/imgs/a/26/leap_strike.png">
<p>Even if the comet burns up in the atmosphere, its momentum is
transmitted to the surface by wind drag (taking a matter of days). It
takes <a href="http://www.researchgate.net/publication/227650235_Topographic_CoreMantle_Coupling_and_Polar_Motion_On_Decadal_TimeScales">about a
decade</a> for
the core to sync up with the crust, so we’d have to plan the impact
schedule carefully to avoid overshooting.</p>
<p>Here’s the bad news: To get enough spin, we have to hit the Earth with
on the order of a billion liters of rock per second (several times the
volumetric discharge rate of the Amazon). This adds up to about one
six-mile dinosaur-killing asteroid every couple days. Humanity—and
life—wouldn’t survive the bombardment long.</p>
<p>What about a steady stream of smaller asteroids?</p>
<img class="illustration" title="the bullet" src="/imgs/a/26/leap_prince.png">
<p>If asteroid B-612 in The Little Prince is four meters across and made of
rock, we’d need an average of around fifty thousand of them to enter the
atmosphere each second to keep up the pressure.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="is programming convenience worth *this*? is it, anton?" src="/imgs/a/26/leap_prince_rows.png">
<p>Unfortunately, the steady high-altitude meteor shower would deliver just
as much energy to the atmosphere that daily giant impacts would, and the
eventual death toll would be the same: Seven billion humans, plus four
billion Little Princes per day.</p>
<p>But at least we could stop worrying about leap seconds.</p>
