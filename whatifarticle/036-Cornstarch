  <p id="question">How much cornstarch can I rinse down the drain before unpleasant things start to happen?</p>
<p id="attribute">—Anna R., Fort Wayne, IN</p>
<p>It depends what you consider unpleasant.</p>
<p>If you watered down the cornstarch enough, you could likely pour it down
the drain for years without any ill effects. If it didn’t clog the sink,
the rest of the pipes could probably handle it. It might provoke some
confusion among the sewage treatment people, but it wouldn’t break
anything.</p>
<p>But it’d be terrifically boring (and thus unpleasant) to pour cornstarch
down a sink all day, so I guess that’s—</p>
<img class="illustration" title="the questioner pours cornstarch into a drain" src="/imgs/a/36/cornstarch_boring.png">
<p>… Oh. Huh.</p>
<p>Well, let’s thicken the cornstarch.</p>
<p>When you mix cornstarch and water in a bit under a 2:1 ratio, you get
oobleck, a substance with some odd physical properties. This is a great
kitchen science experiment everyone should try at least once.</p>
<p>At low speeds, oobleck behaves like a liquid. If you gently swish your
fingers in a bowl of it, it feels like milk or heavy cream. However, if
you make a fist and punch the surface, your hand bounces off with a
thud—it’s like hitting a slab of raw meat.</p>
<p>If you vibrate oobleck, even <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zoTKXXNQIU">stranger things
happen</a>.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t take much of the mixture to clog a drain. It depends on your
plumbing, but you could probably stop up your sink with a small bowl of
it.</p>
<p>Since your drain is clogged, I guess that’s the answer to your question.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="the drain is clogged but it's ok" src="/imgs/a/36/cornstarch_clogged.png">
<p>Well, ok. I guess some people don’t mind clogged drains.</p>
<p>If you keep at it, after a few minutes, your sink will overflow,
spilling goop onto your floor.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="let the cornstarch hit the floor" src="/imgs/a/36/cornstarch_floor.png">
<p>Financially, this will be hard to keep up. If you’re mixing as fast as
the water will come out of the sink, this project may cost you in the
neighborhood of $5,000 per day if you can’t find a good bulk
distributor.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="by the time you read this, bitcoins will be either hilariously expensive or hilariously cheap" src="/imgs/a/36/cornstarch_bitcoins.png">
<p>At this rate, it should build up on the floor at a rate of an inch or
two per day.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="pouring cornstarch into the sink is endless fun" src="/imgs/a/36/cornstarch_fun.png">
<p>If your doors are sealed well, it will continue to build up. Once it
reaches knee height (a week or two after you started), you may be able
to hold the rising tide at bay for a little bit—at least in one room—by
getting someone to flush the toilet repeatedly. The pipes there are
larger and harder to clog; the limiting factor would probably be how
fast the tank filled with water.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="this is probably a violation of your lease" src="/imgs/a/36/cornstarch_toilet.png">
<p>Eventually, after a month or two, the oobleck would reach the living
room window. The pressure would quickly rise, and sooner or later the
window would burst.</p>
<p>As the deadly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Molasses_Disaster">Boston Molasses
Flood</a> proved,
even thick, viscous fluids can flow quickly when in large enough
quantities. The oobleck would pour rapidly out onto the lawn, carrying
you with it.</p>
<p>At this point, the local officials would probably notice and, at the
very least, shut off your water.</p>

<p>But I guess if you really like cornstarch that much, nothing unpleasant
has happened.</p>
