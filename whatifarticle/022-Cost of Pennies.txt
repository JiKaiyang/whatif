  <p id="question">If you carry a penny in your coin tray, how long would it take for that penny to cost you more than a cent in extra gas?</p>
<p id="attribute">—Leto Atreides</p>
<p>At current prices, 140,000 miles, close to the average car’s lifetime
mileage:</p>
<p>\[1\text{ cent}\times\left (
\frac{30\frac{\text{miles}}{\text{gallon}}} {\frac{2.73\text{
grams}}{50\text{
pounds}}\times0.5%\times\frac{$3.50}{\text{gallon}}} \right
)\approx140,000\text{ miles}\]</p>
<p>That means that as long as you go through pennies faster than you go
through cars, you’re coming out ahead. (The equation assumes, for a 30
mpg car, 50 lbs of cargo <a href="http://priuschat.com/threads/heavy-weight-drivers-effecting-mpg.41923/#ixzz2Chj07sVA">means a 0.5%
hit</a> in
fuel economy.)</p>
<p>But gas money isn’t the only cost attached to a penny. Let’s consider
some of the others.</p>
<p>Suppose you found it on the ground on the way to your car. How much did
it cost you to pick it up in the first place?</p>
<p>How much is your time worth? This obviously depends on a lot of things
and varies from time to time and person to person. But for a broad
estimate, I sometimes use a ballpark value of $10/hour—which is
somewhere between the US minimum wage and the average wage—but you can
adjust up or down to fit your preference.</p>
<p>If your time is worth $10 an hour, a penny is worth 3.6 seconds. If
spotting and picking up a penny takes you more than 3.6 seconds, it’s a
loss.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="actually, wait, is that a wheat penny?" src="/imgs/a/22/pennies_notime.png">
<p>Of course, picking it up isn’t the only time cost. Having a penny in
your pocket makes it harder to find other things there, so you might
spend more time looking for stuff in the future.</p>
<p>And then there’s the future time spent dealing with the penny. You may
spend time figuring out if it helps you make change, putting it in a
roll, donating them, or doing countless other hard-to-predict things.
<em>(You may argue that dropping them in a donation jar is noble enough
that it makes picking them up worthwhile. That may be true; it’s what I
do with pennies. But this isn’t an argument against donating money—it’s
just an argument that picking up pennies may not be an efficient way to
use your time to acquire money to donate.)</em></p>
<p>There’s another cost (and benefit) to picking up a penny—the calories
burned. When you crouch to pick up a penny, you expend energy. A
70-kilogram person who lowers their center of mass by half a meter will
burn about half a calorie of energy standing back up:</p>
<p>\[\frac{70\text{ kg}\times\text{Earth Gravity}\times50\text{
centimeters}}{20\%}=1.72\text{ kJ}=0.41\text{ food calories}\]</p>
<p><em>(The “20%” represents the overall energy efficiency of the squatting
process, which I based on the <a href="http://phys.org/news/2011-03-energy-bill-stair-climbing.html">efficiency of stair
climbing</a>.)</em></p>
<p>All else being equal, to replenish those 0.41 extra calories, you’ll
need to eat 0.41 calories worth of extra food. And food costs money.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="a chart which can replace two semesters of economics and three of agronomy" src="/imgs/a/22/pennies_food.png">
<p>Donuts provide <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304898704577482822982322972.html">836 calories per
dollar</a>,
or 8.3 calories per penny—plenty to supply the 0.41 needed to pick one
up. On the other hand, if you get your energy from expensive fresh
strawberries, you might only get 20 calories per dollar—meaning that
picking up that penny costs you 2 cents in extra strawberry. (In dollars
per calorie, the cheapest energy sources in the supermarket are refined
sugar, oil, and shortening).</p>
<p>But on the other hand, burning calories is exercise, which is good for
you. Crouching to pick up that penny is equivalent to two or three
seconds on an exercise machine. What’s that worth?</p>
<img class="illustration" title="picking up a penny is a potentially exhausting activity" src="/imgs/a/22/pennies_fitocracy.png">
<p>Well, <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(11)60749-6/abstract">one
study</a> suggests
that 15 minutes of moderate exercise per day adds three years to your
life expectancy (with smaller improvements in mortality rate for
progressively more daily exercise). It’s a tremendous
oversimplification, but a crude back-of-the-envelope estimate suggests
each calorie burned adds something like 30 seconds to your life—or 12
seconds per penny.</p>
<p>But wait—if it only takes a couple seconds to pick up a penny, but it
pays back 12 seconds, then you could game the system by repeatedly
dropping a penny and picking it back up ...</p>
<img class="illustration" title="a lifespan is boosted by repeatedly picking up a penny" src="/imgs/a/22/pennies_hack.png">
<p>… which is just another way of saying that exercise is a good idea.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="a realization occurs in the brain" src="/imgs/a/22/pennies_right.png">
<p>One final thought:</p>
<p>This article is about 770 words long. If you read at 250 words per
minute, then add in another couple minutes for the drawings and
equations, then reading this article has eaten up 300 seconds of your
time. At $10/hour, that’s 83 cents.</p>
<p>Which means that by reading this article, you’ve quite possibly erased
the gains from all the pennies you’ll pick up in your entire life
<em>and</em> any gains in fuel economy due to keeping a clean change cup.</p>
