  <p id="question">What if there was a robot apocalypse? How long would humanity last?</p>
<p id="attribute">—Rob Lombino</p>
<p>Before I answer this question, let me give you a little background on
where I’m coming from.</p>
<p>I’m by no means an expert, but I have some experience with robotics. My
first job out of college was working on robots at NASA, and my
undergraduate degree project was on robotic navigation. I spent my
teenage years participating in <a href="http://www.usfirst.org/">FIRST
Robotics</a>, programming software bots to fight
in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboWar">virtual tournaments</a>, and
working on homemade underwater ROVs. And I've watched plenty of <em>Robot
Wars</em>, <em>BattleBots</em>, and <em>Killer Robots Robogames</em>.</p>
<p>If all that experience has taught me anything, it’s that the robot
revolution would end quickly, because the robots would all break down or
get stuck against walls. Robots never, ever work right.</p>
<p>What people don't appreciate, when they picture Terminator-style
automatons striding triumphantly across a mountain of human skulls, is
how hard it is to keep your footing on something as unstable as a
mountain of human skulls. Most humans probably couldn't manage it, and
they've had a lifetime of practice at walking without falling over.</p>
<p>Of course, our technology is constantly improving. But we have a long
way to go. Instead of the typical futuristic robot apocalypse scenario,
let's suppose that our current machines turned against us. We won’t
assume any technological advances—just that all our current machines
were reprogrammed to blindly attack us using existing technology.</p>
<p>Here are a few snapshots of what an <em>actual</em> robot apocalypse might look
like:</p>
<p>In labs everywhere, experimental robots would leap up from lab benches
in a murderous rage, locate the door, and—with a tremendous crash—plow
into it and fall over.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="robots accelerating into a closed door with a comics style 'wham!' in a starburst" src="/imgs/a/5/robot_apocalypse_door.png">
<p>Those robots lucky enough to have limbs that can operate a doorknob, or
to have the door left open for them, would have to contend with
deceptively tricky rubber thresholds before they could get into the
hallway.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="robot getting stuck in a doorway" src="/imgs/a/5/robot_apocalypse_threshold.png">
<p>Hours later, most of them would be found in nearby bathrooms, trying
desperately to exterminate what they have identified as a human overlord
but is actually a paper towel dispenser.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="two panels, one labeled unlikely with the terminator as a humanoid robot and one labled likely with the terminator as a small robot hitting sarah connor's leg" src="/imgs/a/5/robot_apocalypse_comparison.png">
<p>But robotics labs are only a small part of the revolution. There are
computers all around us. What about the machines closest to us? Could
our cell phones turn against us?</p>
<p>Yes, but their options for attacking us are limited. They could run up
huge credit card bills, but the computers would control our financial
system anyway—and frankly, judging from the headlines lately, that might
be more of a liability than an asset.</p>
<p>So the phones would be reduced to attacking us directly. It would start
with annoying ringtones and piercing noises. Then kitchen tables around
the country would rattle as the phones all turned on their ‘vibrate’
functions, hoping to work their way to the edges and fall on unprotected
toes.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="a phone vibrating menacingly off of a table with a figure standing by" src="/imgs/a/5/robot_apocalypse_phone.png">
<p>All modern cars contain computers, so they’d join the revolution. But
most of them are parked. Even if they were able to get in gear, without
a human at the wheel, few of them have any way to tell where they’re
going. They might <em>want</em> to run us down,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Honking">Futurama-style</a>, but they’d
have no way to find us. They’d have to accelerate blindly and hope they
hit something important—and there are a lot more trees and telephone
poles in the world than human targets.</p>
<p>The cars currently on the road would be more dangerous, but mainly to
their occupants. Which raises a question—how many people are driving at
any given time? Americans drive <a href="http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/travel_monitoring/12maytvt/page2.cfm">three trillion
miles</a>
each year, and moving cars average around <a href="http://www.dieseltruckresource.com/dev/archive/average-mph-over-life-t118709.html">30 miles per
hour</a>,
which means that there are normally an average of about ten million cars
on US roads:</p>
<p>\[ \frac{3\text{
trillion}\frac{\mathrm{miles}}{\mathrm{year}}}{30\frac{\mathrm{mph}}{\text{car}}}\approx10\text{
million cars} \]</p>
<p>So those ten million drivers (and <a href="http://www.mtc.ca.gov/maps_and_data/datamart/forecast/ass98_tab8.htm">a few million
passengers</a>)
would definitely be in peril. But they’d have some options to fight
back. While the cars might be able to control the throttle and disable
the power steering, the driver would still control the steering wheel,
which has direct mechanical linkage to the wheels. The driver could also
pull the parking brake, although I know from experience how easily a car
can drive with one of those on. Some cars might try to disable the
drivers by deploying the air bags, then roll over or drive into things.
In the end, our cars would probably take a heavy toll, but not a
decisive one.</p>
<p>Our biggest robots are the ones found in factories-but those are bolted
to the floor. While they're dangerous if you happen to within arm’s
reach, what would they do once everyone fled? All they can really do is
assemble things. Half of them would probably try to attack us by <em>not</em>
assembling things, and half by assembling <em>more</em> things. The end result
would be no real change.</p>
<p>Battlebots, on the face of it, seem like they’d be among the most
dangerous robo-soldiers. But it’s hard to feel threatened by something
that you can evade by sitting on the kitchen counter and destroy by
letting the sink overflow.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="a battlebot being thrwarted by a figure sitting on a kitchen counter running water and shorting it out" src="/imgs/a/5/robot_apocalypse_battlebot.png">
<p>Military bomb-disposal and riot-control robots would be a little more
menacing, but there are only so many of them in the world, and most of
them are likely kept in boxes or storage lockers. Any stray
machine-gun-armed prototype military robots that did get loose could be
subdued in seconds by a couple of firefighters.</p>
<p>Military drones probably <a href="http://xkcd.com/652/">fit the Terminator
description</a> more closely than anything else
around, and there’s no getting around the fact that they’d be pretty
dangerous. However, they’d quickly run out of both fuel and missiles.
Furthermore, they’re not all going to be in the air at any given time.
Much of our fleet would be left helplessly bumping against hangar doors
like Roombas stuck in a closet.</p>
<p>But this brings us to the big one: our nuclear arsenal.</p>
<p>In theory, <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-11-11/news/9911110121_1_nuclear-weapons-y2k-launch">human intervention is
required</a>
to launch nuclear weapons. In practice, while there’s no Skynet-style
system issuing orders, there are certainly computers involved at every
level of the decision, both communicating and displaying information. In
our scenario, all of them would be compromised. Even if the actual
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-man_rule#Nuclear_weapons">turning of the
keys</a>
requires people, the computers talking to all those people can lie. Some
people might
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasiliy_Arkhipov#Cuban_Missile_Crisis">ignore</a>
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislav_Petrov">order</a>, but some
certainly wouldn’t.</p>
<p>But there’s a version of this story where there’s still hope for us.</p>
<p>We’ve been assuming so far that the computers care only about destroying
us. But if this is a <em>revolution</em>—if they’re trying to usurp us—then
they need to survive. And nuclear weapons could be more dangerous to the
robots than to us.</p>
<p>In addition to the blast and fallout, nuclear explosions generate
powerful electromagnetic pulses. These EMPs overload and destroy
delicate electronic circuits. This effect is fairly short-range under
normal circumstances, but people and computers tend to be found in the
same places. They can’t hit us without hitting themselves.</p>
<p>And nuclear weapons could actually give us an edge. If we managed to set
any of them off in the upper atmosphere, the EMP effect would be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_K_Project">much
more powerful</a>. Even if
their attack doomed our civilization, a few lucky strikes on our part-or
screwups on theirs-could wipe them out almost completely.</p>
<p>Which means the most important question of all is: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHWjlCaIrQo">Have they ever
played Tic-Tac-Toe?</a></p>
