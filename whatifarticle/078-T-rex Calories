  <p id="question">If a T-rex were released in New York City, how many humans/day would it need to consume to get its needed calorie intake?</p>
<p id="attribute">Tony Schmitz</p>
<p>About half of an adult, or one ten-year old child:</p>

<p><em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em> weighed about as much as an elephant.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[1]</span><span class="refbody">This always seemed a little off to me; my mental image of elephants is that they're in the same size range as cars or trucks, whereas T-rex, as <em>Jurassic Park</em> showed, is big enough to stomp on cars. But a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;q=elephant+car">Google image search for car+elephant</a> shows elephants looming over cars just like the T-rex in Jurassic Park. So, great, now I'm also afraid of elephants.</span></span></p>

<p>No one is totally sure what dinosaur metabolism looked like, but the best guesses for how much food T-rex ate seem to cluster around 40,000 calories per day.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[2]</span><span class="refbody">Food calories (kcal). Sources: <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/106/29/12184.full">This</a> and <a href="http://palaeo-electronica.org/1999_2/gigan/issue2_99.htm">this</a>, and <a href="http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2666002">this</a> with some notes from <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0026037">this</a> and distraction from <a href="http://regex.alf.nu/">this</a>. </span></span></p>
<p>If we assume dinosaurs had metabolisms similar to today's mammals, they'd eat a lot more than 40,000 calories each day. But the current thinking is that while dinosaurs were more active (loosely speaking, "warm-blooded") than modern snakes and lizards, very large dinosaurs probably had metabolisms that more closely resembled komodo dragons than elephants and tigers.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[3]</span><span class="refbody">For big sauropods, we know this must be the case, because otherwise they would overheat. However, there's a lot of uncertainty surrounding T-rex-sized dinosaurs.</span></span></p>
<p>Next, we need to know how many calories are in a human. This number is helpfully provided, by Dinosaur Comics author Ryan North, on <a href="http://www.topatoco.com/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=TO&amp;Product_Code=QW-PERSON&amp;Category_Code=QW">this wonderful t-shirt</a>. Ryan's shirt tells us that an 80-kg human contains about 110,000 calories of energy.</p>
<p>Therefore, a T-rex would need to consume a human every two days or so.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[4]</span><span class="refbody">Although a T-rex would likely be willing to eat several days to weeks worth of food in one meal, so if it has the option, it might eat a bunch of people at a time, then go for a while without eating.</span></span> The city of New York had 239,736 births in 2011, which could support a population of about 1,000 tyrannosaurs. However, this ignores immigrationâ€”and, more importantly, <em>em</em>igration, which would probably increase substantially in this scenario.</p>

<p>The 33,000 McDonald's restaurants worldwide sell something like 15 billion hamburger patties per year,<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[5]</span><span class="refbody">They stopped reporting the "x billions served" number on their signs, but <a href="http://overhowmanybillionserved.blogspot.com/">this website</a> has some extrapolations.</span></span> for an average of 1,245 burgers per restaurant per day. 1,245 burgers is about 600,000 calories, which means that each T-rex only needs about 80 hamburgers per day to survive, and one McDonald's could support over a dozen tyrannosaurs on hamburgers alone.</p>

<p>Ands if you live in New York, and you see a T-rex, don't worry. You don't have to choose a friend to sacrifice; just order 80 burgers instead.</p>
<p>And then if the T-rex goes for your friend anyway, hey, you have 80 burgers.</p>
