  <p id="question">If you wanted to anchor an airplane into the ground so it wouldn't be able to take off, what would the rope have to be made out of?</p>
<p id="attribute">â€”Connor Childerhose</p>
<p>Ah, the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=just+cause+2+plane+grapple"><em>Just Cause 2</em> scenario</a>.</p>
<p>At takeoff, a 747's four engines can each generate 281.57 kN of thrust. I have no real sense for what that number means, so let's put it in different terms:</p>
<img class="illustration" title="Now, you put this whole contraption on a treadmill ..." src="/imgs/a/56/747_whale.png">
<p>A 747 with all engines at full could roughly balance the weight of a dangling blue whale.</p>
<p>With all that weight, how thick would the cable need to be?</p>
<p>Surprisingly, not all that thick! A cable a little over an inch in diameter would do it.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[1]</span><span class="refbody">Bethlehem Wire Rope <a href="http://www.wwwrope.com/product_pdfs/GP_CAT.pdf">General Purpose Catalog</a></span></span></p>
<p>Let's suppose you don't have a cable lying around. What else could you use?</p>
<p>If you're into fishing, you might have some fishing line. A typical line for saltwater fishing might have a 50-100 lb strength,<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[2]</span><span class="refbody">West Marine: <a href="http://www.wwwrope.com/product_pdfs/GP_CAT.pdf">Selecting Fishing Line</a></span></span> so it would take a brigade of several thousand people armed with fishing rods to restrain the plane.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="Oh yeah? Well, the one *I* almost caught once was even bigger, and made out of wood! I swear it was real!" src="/imgs/a/56/747_fishing.png">
<p>If you don't have fishing line, there's one thing you probably do have: Hair.</p>
<p>While hair isn't as strong as steel, it's just about the strongest material in your body,<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[3]</span><span class="refbody"><a href="http://web2.clarkson.edu/class/me380/materials_tenstrength.pdf">Examples of the Tensile Strength of Materials</a></span></span> with a tensile strength rivaling or exceeding that of bone.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[4]</span><span class="refbody"><a href="http://www.academia.edu/2179355/Properties_of_Textile_Fibers">Properties of Textile Fibers</a></span></span></p>
<p>This tensile strength is why performers are able to hang by their hair at the circus. In fact, from a materials standpoint, it's actually more impressive that performers are able to hang by their <em>arms</em>.</p>
<p>Based on these hair strength figures, a piece of hair three inches in diameter would be strong enough to restrain a 747.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[5]</span><span class="refbody">If you wanted to measure the strength of a strand of hair, you could use the device described by <a href="http://www.google.com/patents/US4628742">US Patent #4628742A</a>, "Tensile strength tester for hair" </span></span></p>
<p>Hairs that big around are hard to come by.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[6]</span><span class="refbody">... I hope.</span></span> Since most of us have many small hairs, instead of one big hair ...</p>
<img class="illustration" title="Why does nobody want to hang out with me??" src="/imgs/a/56/747_single.png">
<p>... we'd need to get a lot of hairs and bundle them together. Given that individual hairs can support about 50 grams of weight, we'd need roughly 20 heads of hair to restrain the aircraft.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="Hair Force One" src="/imgs/a/56/747_hair.png">
<p>Conclusion: Restraining a plane with a cable would be pretty easy.</p>
<p>Further conclusion: Blue whales are not typically covered in hair,<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[8]</span><span class="refbody">Although they are mammals, most whales <a href="http://bioweb.uwlax.edu/bio203/s2012/olson_rile/adaptation.htm">do not have coats of hair like land mammals typically do</a></span></span> but if we transplanted the hair from at least 20 human heads onto a blue whale ...</p>
<img class="illustration" title="I hope that answers your question." src="/imgs/a/56/747_whale_hang.png">
<p>... it would have enough hair to perform acrobatics at a circus.</p>
