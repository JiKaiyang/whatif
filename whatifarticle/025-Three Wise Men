  <p id="question">The story of the three wise men got me wondering: What if you did walk towards a star at a fixed speed?  What path would you trace on the Earth? Does it converge to a fixed cycle?</p>
<p id="attribute">—N. Murdoch</p>
<p>If the wise men leave Jerusalem and walk toward the star Sirius, day and
night, even when it’s below the horizon, this is the path they follow
over the surface:</p>

<p>If we allow a little theological confusion and assume the wise men can
walk on water, they’ll eventually wind up going in an endless circle, 30
kilometers in diameter, around the South Pole.</p>
<p>But let’s be a little more realistic; the wise men are hardly going to
walk toward the star while it’s behind the Earth. Let’s assume that they
only walk toward the star when it’s in the sky and the Sun has set.</p>
<p>In that case, their path actually takes them through Bethlehem:</p>

<p>If they don’t stop there, after a few years, they wind up orbiting
Botswana:</p>

<p>These paths are calculated using, among other things,
<a href="http://rhodesmill.org/pyephem/">PyEphem</a>, which provides tools for
determining the historical positions of astronomical objects.</p>
<p>It’s tricky to figure out exactly what the wise men would have been
following. There aren’t very many <a href="http://www.observadores-cometas.com/Star_of_Bethlehem/English/Whatnot.htm">good astronomical
candidates</a> for
the Star of Bethlehem (Chinese records don’t show a supernova at the
right time, and none of the other obvious candidates check out) and,
furthermore, there’s a lot of historical and theological debate over
Jesus’s date of birth (“4 BC” seems to be the closest thing to a
historical consensus date). These charts are all calculated for a
somewhat arbitrary departure date from Jerusalem of December 25th, 1 AD;
different departure days would lead to different paths, but the overall
picture would be the same.</p>
<p>What if the wise men followed a planet?</p>
<p>Planets move against the background of stars, so the paths they produce
are more complex. Here’s where the Wise Men would’ve gone if they
followed Venus:</p>
<img class="illustration" title="the wise men lose interest in the child and vacation in tripoli and the red sea instead" src="/imgs/a/25/magi_venus.png">
<p>And here’s their path for Mars:</p>
<img class="illustration" title="the three wise men look for the baby jesus atop mt. everest, which is a logical place to look if you assume he's descending from heaven and stopping at the first land he reaches" src="/imgs/a/25/magi_mars.png">
<p>If the three wise men had a hovercar that could move at highway speed
over land and water (it’s in the gnostic gospels somewhere) and decided
to follow Venus, they’d take a particularly weird path:</p>
<img class="illustration" title="the three wise men and their magical hovercar, starring donald glover, kal penn, andy samberg, and neil patrick harris as the hovercar" src="/imgs/a/25/magi_venus_car.png">
<p>At one point, they wind up near the North Pole in October. There, the
Sun and Venus spend months near the horizon, rising and setting, nudging
the Magi into a month-long spiral around the pole, a chaotic strange
Magi attractor around the North Pole which some argue provides the
theological foundation for the story of Santa
Claus <sup>[<span style="color:#0645ad; font-style:italic; font-weight: bold;font-family: sans-serif;">citation needed</span>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Sadly, the three wise men probably weren’t following Venus. It’s one of
the most familiar objects in the night sky, and as the late Sir Patrick
Moore observed, if the wise men mistook it for a new star, they couldn’t
have been very wise.</p>
<p>But maybe they’re wiser than Sir Patrick gives them credit for. After
all, if you pick a random star in the sky, point at the horizon, and
predict that there’s a baby about to be born in that direction,
statistics—and birth rates—are on your side.</p>
