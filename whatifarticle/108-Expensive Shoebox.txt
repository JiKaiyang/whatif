  <p id="question">What would be the most expensive way to fill a size 11 shoebox (e.g. with 64 GB MicroSD cards all full of legally purchased music)?</p>
<p id="attribute">Rick Lewis</p>
<p>A shoebox full of valuable stuff seems to top out at about $2 billion. Surprisingly, this turns out to be true for a wide range of possible fillings.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="Plus the value of the box." src="/imgs/a/108/billion.png">
<p>The MicroSD cards are a good idea. iTunes songs cost about $1 each, and MicroSD cards have a capacity of about 1.6 petabytes per gallon. A men's size 11 shoebox is about 10-15 liters, depending on the brand and type of shoe, which means it can hold up to 1.5 billion 4 MB songs (at about a dollar each). (That's about 20 times as many songs as the iTunes store offers, so you'll have to buy some of the songs more than once.)</p>
<p>Expensive software like Adobe®©™ Photoshop®©™ CS®™ 5™ has a slightly higher cost-to-megabyte ratio, since it retails for several hundred dollars and takes up several hundred megabytes of space. Or, at least, it used to, until Adobe moved to a <a href="http://www.istockphoto.com/photo/your-own-cloud-20501613">cloud model</a>.</p>
<p>Once you start considering software prices, you can probably crank the "cost" of things in a shoebox as high as you want by making unlimited in-app purchases. And while the resulting RPG character may technically represent the result of your spending that much money, it's hard to argue with a straight face that your character is in any sense worth a trillion dollars.</p>

<p>So let's think about actual objects.</p>
<p>There's gold, of course. 13 liters of gold is worth <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=13+liters+*+gold+density+*+gold+price">about $10 million</a> as of this writing. <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=13+liters+*+platinum+density+*+platinum+price">Platinum</a> is a little more expensive at $13 million/shoebox.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[1]</span><span class="refbody">Not yet an SI unit, sadly.</span></span> That's about 10 times the value of a shoebox full of $100 bills. On the other hand, a shoebox full of gold would <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=gold+density+*+13+liters">weigh</a> as much as a small horse.</p>
<p>There are more expensive metals. A gram of pure plutonium, for example, would cost <a href="http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2008/AndrewMorel.shtml">about $5k</a>. As a bonus, plutonium is even denser than gold, which means you could fit almost 300 kilograms of it in a shoebox.</p>
<p>Before you spend $3 billion on plutonium, take note: Plutonium's critical mass is about 10 kilograms. So while you could fit 300 kilograms of it in a shoebox, you could only do so <em>briefly</em>.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="This means you're unlikely to find a buyer, or—if you can offer to assemble the shoebox at a specific time and place, maybe MORE likely." src="/imgs/a/108/nuke.png">
<p>High-quality diamonds are expensive, but it's hard to get a handle on their exact price because <strike>the entire industry was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Beers_Diamonds_Antitrust_Litigation">built on</a> a scam</strike> the gemstone market is complicated. <a href="http://www.info-diamond.com/others/diamond-prices.html">One site</a> quotes a price of over \$300,000 for a flawless 600 mg (3 carat) diamond—which means that a shoebox full of perfect-quality gem diamonds could be worth as much as \$20 billion—but \$1 or \$2 billion is more reasonable.</p>

<p>Many illegal drugs are, by weight, more valuable than gold. Cocaine's price varies a lot, but in many areas is in the neighborhood of $100/gram.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[2]</span><span class="refbody">My search history after researching <a href="http://www.havocscope.com/black-market-prices/cocaine-prices/">drug street prices</a> would probably get me on all kinds of government watch lists, if I weren't on them all already for all the <em>other</em> things I've researched for this blog.</span></span> Gold is currently less than half that. However, cocaine is much less <em>dense</em> than gold,<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[3]</span><span class="refbody">But wait—what <em>is</em> the density of cocaine? As usual, the Straight Dope Message Board folks are on the case; in <a href="http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=298784">this discussion</a>, they consult the CRC Handbook and Merck Index, before giving up and deciding that it's probably about 1 kg/L, like most organic substances. They do, however, learn its boiling point and solubility in olive oil.</span></span> so a shoebox full of cocaine would be less valuable than one of gold.</p>
<p>Cocaine is not the most expensive drug by weight. LSD—probably the most widely-consumed substance sold to consumers by the microgram—costs about a thousand times more than cocaine by weight. A shoebox full of pure LSD would be worth about $2.5 billion.</p>
<p>Some prescription drugs can be just as expensive as LSD. A single dose of brentuximab vedotin (<strong>Adcetris</strong>) can cost \$13,500, which—for the average patient—puts its shoebox value in the same \$2 billion range as LSD, plutonium, and MicroSD cards. Other drugs are even more expensive.</p>
<p>Of course, you could always put <em>shoes</em> in the shoebox.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="Oh, I guess if you don't wear them while they're in the box it's ok." src="/imgs/a/108/weird.png">
<p>Judy Garland's shoes from <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> sold at auction for $666,000, and—unlike the other things we've considered—may have, at one point, actually been placed in a shoebox.</p>
<p>If you really want to fill a shoebox with an arbitrarily large amount of money, you could get the US Treasury to mint you a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trillion_dollar_coin#Legal_basis">trillion-dollar platinum coin</a>.</p>
<p>But if you're open to leveraging our monetary system's legal authority to impart value into an arbitrary inanimate object ...</p>
<img class="illustration" title="People disagree about spelling it 'check' vs. 'cheque', but at least we can all agree that it will be nice when we can stop using the word entirely." src="/imgs/a/108/check.png">
<p>... you could just write a check.</p>
