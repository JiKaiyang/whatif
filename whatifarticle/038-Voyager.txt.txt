  <p id="question">With today's technology, would it be possible to launch an unmanned mission to retrieve Voyager I?</p>
<p id="attribute">—Elliott Bennett</p>
<p><em>Voyager I</em> is farther from Earth than any other manmade object. After
getting a pair of gravitational kicks from Jupiter and Saturn, it’s
headed out of the Solar System at a pretty high speed, and nothing else
we’ve built is on track to pass it.</p>
<p>Strangely, as of the day I’m writing this, <em>Voyager</em> is actually
<a href="http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/where/">getting closer</a> to
us, because Earth is in a part of its orbit where it’s approaching
<em>Voyager</em> faster than <em>Voyager</em> is fleeing. But in a few months, we’ll
swing around the Sun and <em>Voyager</em> will again be getting farther away.</p>

<p>It has a 35-year head start, so it would be hard to catch. But catching
up isn’t the problem.</p>
<p><em>New Horizons</em>, the spacecraft currently headed out of the Solar System
by way of Pluto, is never going to catch up to <em>Voyager</em>—it’s not moving
fast enough and it’s headed in the wrong direction<em>.</em> But it could have.</p>
<p>The reason <em>Voyager</em> is moving so fast is that it got gravitational
assists from Jupiter and Saturn, while <em>New Horizons</em> only got one from
Jupiter.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="Voyager gets a boost from Jupiter and a ball gets a boost from a truck." src="/imgs/a/38/voyager_assist.png">
<p><em>Gravity assists aren’t paradoxical magic. It’s just like bouncing a
tennis ball off a passing truck. Gyroscopes, on the other hand, ARE
magic.</em></p>
<p>If <em>New Horizons</em> had ditched the Pluto objective and waited for the
right planetary alignment (the 2030s look promising), it could have
swung by Jupiter and Saturn, then caught up to <em>Voyager</em> in as little as
a century or two! (Assuming we could manage to hit Voyager from that far
away. But I bet we could; our rocket scientists are pretty good at
rocket science.)</p>
<p>Of course, getting there’s the easy part. The hard part is getting back.</p>
<p><em>Voyager</em> weighs a little less than a ton and is moving away at 17
kilometers per second (if it were in the atmosphere, that would be Mach
50). And since it’s out in interstellar space, there are no speeding
Jupiters to grab on to. Stopping <em>Voyager</em> is going to take a <em>lot</em> of
fuel.</p>
<p>It’s what engineers call the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition30/tryanny.html">tyranny of the rocket
equation</a>:
As the amount that you want to change your speed (“delta-v”) goes up,
the fuel required increases exponentially. The equation tells us that to
turn the 720-kilogram <em>Voyager</em> around, we’re going to need at least
30<em> tons</em> of fuel.</p>
<p>But to get <em>that</em> fuel out there, we need even <em>more</em> fuel. And to get
<em>that</em> fuel, we need even <em>more</em> fuel. (This is where the tyrannical
rocket equation gets its exponential term.) In fact, to rescue Voyager,
we’d have to launch a fleet of—at minimum—60 <em>New Horizons</em>-sized
spacecraft loaded with nothing but fuel.</p>
<p>Could we do it? Sure. There are a couple plausible ways. Instead of
building five to ten dozen fuel-laden Titan IIIEs, we could just build a
fleet of ten or fifteen Saturn Vs, and do the whole thing with fewer
launches. But however we did it, it would be a massive and expensive
operation similar in scale to the Apollo program.</p>
<p>The difference between the launch vehicle we’d used to get Voyager out
of the Solar System and the fleet we’d need for a round trip is
striking:</p>

<p>Fortunately, there’s one way around the tyranny of the rocket equation:
Ditch the rockets.</p>
<p>Ion engines—which use electric fields to accelerate exhaust gas to high
speeds—are far more efficient than chemical rockets, and they make
accelerating to high speeds much more plausible.</p>
<p>The reason we’re not using them for everything is that they produce very
little thrust, so it takes a long time to get up to speed. It’s like if
you had a car that gets amazing mileage but has a one-horsepower engine.
(Actually, are you sure that’s not just a horse?) Ion engines are great;
the current ones just take forever to get you moving.</p>
<p>But since catching <em>Voyager</em> is going to take a long time anyway, ion
engines are fine. We could launch a probe (like <a href="http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/13644/1/00-0010.pdf">this
one</a>),
send it out to <em>Voyager</em>, latch on, turn everything around, and let it
spend a few decades slowing <em>Voyager</em> down.</p>
<p>Once Voyager had lost nearly all its speed, the Sun’s gravity would take
over, and the probe would begin a long slow slide toward the inner Solar
System. This would take about 200 years, and with some extremely careful
nudges, we could make sure it falls in an Earth-crossing orbit.</p>
<p>Two centuries later, <em>Voyager</em> would reach Earth and, with no way to
slow down, burn up in our atmosphere, because we didn’t think to send
out an aerobraking shell with the rescue craft. So that was a waste of a
few centuries of work and billions upon billions of dollars.</p>

<p>Maybe a better idea would be to borrow a salvage vessel and set sail for
the coast of New South Wales, Australia. There, in the waters off Jervis
Bay, the Australian Royal Navy ship <em>Voyager</em> sank in 1964 after an
accidental collision.</p>
<p>That one’s probably easier to retrieve.</p>
