  <p id="question">How high can a human throw something?</p>
<p id="attribute">—Irish Dave on the Isle of Man</p>
<p>Humans are good at throwing things. In fact, we’re great at it; no other
animal can throw stuff like we can.</p>
<p>It's true that chimpanzees hurl feces (and, on rare occasions, stones),
but they’re not nearly as accurate or precise as
humans. <sup><a href="http://ecodevoevo.blogspot.com/2009/10/prehistory-of-throwing-things.html">[1]</a></sup> <sup><a href="http://www.academia.edu/235788/Chapter_9._Stone_tools_and_the_evolution_of_hominin_and_human_cognition">[2]</a></sup>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antlion">Antlions</a> throw sand, but they
don’t aim it. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archerfish">Archerfish</a> hunt
insects by throwing water droplets, but they use specialized mouths
instead of arms. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horned_lizard">Horned
lizards</a> shoot jets of blood
from their eyes for distances of up to five feet. I don’t know <em>why</em>
they do this because whenever I reach the phrase “shoot jets of blood
from their eyes” in an article I just stop there and stare at it until I
need to lie down.</p>

<p>So while there are other animals that use projectiles, we’re just about
the only animal that can grab a random object and reliably nail a
target. In fact, we’re so good at it that some researchers have
suggested rock-throwing played a central role in the evolution of the
modern human
brain.<sup>[<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.williamcalvin.com%2F1990s%2F1993Unitary.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFfMzxb3QJNOQ08HHr6aYdPe21bqQ">3</a>]</sup><sup>[<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fpmc%2Farticles%2FPMC1571064%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGcUJmJuwUCG7i5fe-6mvlunkgLQQ">4</a>]</sup></p>
<p>Throwing is hard. In order to deliver a baseball to a batter, a pitcher
has to release the ball at exactly the right point in the throw. A
timing error of half a millisecond in either direction is enough to
cause the ball to miss the strike
zone.<sup>[<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fjn.physiology.org%2Fcontent%2F75%2F3%2F1013.full.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHkQsmhtC8IoIW5WPMmSEW_Oj82_g">5</a>]</sup></p>
<p>To put that in perspective, it takes about <em>five</em> milliseconds for the
fastest nerve impulse to travel the length of the
arm.<sup>[<a href="http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2002/DavidParizh.shtml">6</a>]</sup> That
means that when your arm is still rotating toward the correct position,
the signal to release the ball is already at your wrist. In terms of
timing, this is like a drummer dropping a drumstick from the 10th story
and hitting a drum on the ground <em>on the correct beat</em>.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="wrong kind of drumstick but hey, i like the sound." src="/imgs/a/44/high_throw_drumstick.png">
<p>We seem to be much better at throwing things forward than throwing them
upward. Since we’re going for maximum height, we could use projectiles
that curve upward when you throw them forward; the <a href="http://aerobie.com/products/orbiter.htm">Aerobie
Orbiters</a> I had when I was a
kid often got stuck in the highest treetops. But we could also sidestep
the whole problem by using a device like this one:</p>
<img class="illustration" title="a mechanism for hitting yourself in the head with a baseball after a four-second delay" src="/imgs/a/44/high_throw_redirector.png">
<p>It could be a springboard, a greased chute, or even a dangling
sling—anything that redirects the object upward without adding to—or
subtracting from—its speed. Of course, we could also try this:</p>
<img class="illustration" title="i just came in to get a glass of water let me down" src="/imgs/a/44/high_throw_gravity.png">
<p>But the deflector box seems easier.</p>
<p>I ran through the basic aerodynamic calculations for a baseball thrown
at various speeds. I will give these in units of giraffes:</p>
<img class="illustration" title="recommended SI unit for altitude" src="/imgs/a/44/high_throw_giraffe.png">
<p>The average person can probably throw a baseball at least three giraffes
high:</p>
<img class="illustration" title="top-tier giraffes" src="/imgs/a/44/high_throw_3.png">
<p>Someone with a reasonably good arm could manage five:</p>
<img class="illustration" title="order your giraffe stacks now" src="/imgs/a/44/high_throw_5.png">
<p>A pitcher with an 80 mph fastball could manage ten giraffes:</p>
<img class="illustration" title="act now while supplies are still cooperative" src="/imgs/a/44/high_throw_10.png">
<p>Aroldis Chapman, the holder of the world record for fastest recorded
pitch (105 mph), could in theory launch a baseball 14 giraffes high:</p>
<img class="illustration" title="buy one from the top rows and get a bottom-row one free" src="/imgs/a/44/high_throw_14.png">
<p>But what about projectiles other than a baseball? Obviously, with the
aid of tools like slings, crossbows, or the curved <em>xistera</em> scoops in
jai alai, we can launch projectiles much faster than that. But for this
question, let’s assume we stick to bare-handed throwing.</p>
<p>A baseball is probably not the ideal projectile, but it’s hard to find
speed data on other kinds of thrown objects. Fortunately, a British
javelin thrower named Roald Bradstock held a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78OPnVweKeg">random object throwing
competition</a>, in which he
threw everything from dead fish to an actual kitchen sink. Bradstock’s
experience gives us a lot of useful data (and a lot of other data, too).
In particular, it suggests a potentially superior projectile: A golf
ball.</p>
<p>Few professional athletes have been recorded throwing golf balls.
Fortunately, Bradstock has, and he claims a record throw (to first
contact with the ground) of 170
yards.<sup>[<a href="http://recordsetter.com/world-record/world-record-for-throwing-golf-ball/7349#contentsection">7</a>]</sup>
This involved a running start, but even so, it’s reason to think that a
golf ball might work better than a baseball. It makes sense; the
limiting factor in baseball pitches is the torque on the elbow, and the
lighter golf ball might allow the pitching arm to move slightly faster.</p>
<p>The speed improvement from using a golf ball instead of a baseball would
probably not be very large, but it seems plausible that a professional
pitcher with some time to practice could throw a golf ball faster than a
baseball.</p>
<p>If so, based on aerodynamic calculations, Aroldis Chapman could probably
throw a golf ball about sixteen giraffes high:</p>
<img class="illustration" title="one giraffe per tier plus Aroldis plus you makes a team" src="/imgs/a/44/high_throw_16.png">
<p>This is probably about the maximum possible altitude for a thrown
object.</p>
<p>… unless you count the technique by which any five-year-old can beat all
these records easily:</p>
