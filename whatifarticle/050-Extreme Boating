  <p id="question">What would it be like to navigate a rowboat through a lake of mercury? What about bromine? Liquid gallium? Liquid tungsten? Liquid nitrogen? Liquid helium?</p>
<p id="attribute">–Nicholas Aron</p>
<p>Let's take these one at a time.</p>
<p>Bromine and mercury are the only known pure elements that are liquid at
room temperature.</p>
<p>Rowing a boat on a sea of mercury just might be possible.</p>
<p><strong>Mercury</strong> is so dense that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGv_YVQHu7U">steel ball bearings float on the
surface</a>. Your boat would be
so buoyant that you'd barely make a dent in the mercury, and you'd have
to lean your weight into the paddle to get the end of it below the
surface.</p>

<p>In the end, it certainly wouldn't be easy, and you wouldn't be able to
move <em>fast</em>. But you could probably row a little bit.</p>
<p>You should probably avoid splash fights.</p>
<p><strong>Bromine</strong> is about as dense as water, so a standard rowboat could in
theory float on it.</p>
<p>However, Bromine is awful. For one thing, it smells terrible; the name
"bromine" comes from the ancient Greek "brōmos", meaning "stench". If
that weren't enough, it <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCwHzTsx5yY">violently
reacts</a> with a lot of
materials. Hopefully, you're not in an aluminium rowboat.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="The mercury one was going to be the least deadly, wasn't it." src="/imgs/a/50/boat_bromine_aluminium.png">
<p>If that's not incentive enough to avoid it, the <a href="http://avogadro.chem.iastate.edu/MSDS/Br2.htm">Materials Safety Data
Sheet on bromine</a>
includes the following phrases:</p>
<ul>
<li>"severe burns and ulceration"</li>
<li>"perforation of the digestive tract"</li>
<li>"permanent corneal opacification"</li>
<li>"vertigo, anxiety, depression, muscle incoordination, and emotional
instability"</li>
<li>"diarrhea, possibly with blood"</li>
</ul>
<p>You should not get in a splash fight on a bromine lake.</p>
<p><strong>Liquid gallium</strong> is weird stuff. Gallium melts just above room
temperature, like butter, so you can't hold it in your hand for too
long.</p>
<p>It's fairly dense, though not anywhere near as dense as mercury, and
would be easier to row a boat on.</p>
<p>However, once again, you'd better hope the boat isn't made of aluminium,
because aluminium (like many metals) absorbs gallium like a sponge
absorbs water. The gallium spreads throughout the aluminium,
dramatically changing its chemical properties. The modified aluminium is
so weak it can be <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaMWxLCGY0U">pulled apart like wet
paper</a>. This is something
gallium has in common with mercury—both will <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Ilxsu-JlY">destroy
aluminium</a>.</p>
<p>Like my grandma used to say, don't sail an aluminium boat on a gallium
lake. (My grandma was a little strange.)</p>
<p><strong>Liquid tungsten</strong> is really hard to work with.</p>
<p>Tungsten has the highest melting point of any element. This means
there's a lot we don't know about its properties. The reason for
this—and this may sound a little stupid—is that it's hard to study,
because we can't find a container to hold it in. For almost any
container, the material in the container will melt before the tungsten
does. There are a few compounds, like tantalum hafnium carbide, with
slightly higher melting points, but no one has been able to make a
liquid tungsten container with them.</p>
<p>To give you an idea of how hot liquid tungsten is, I could tell you the
exact temperature that it melts at (3422°C). But a better point might be
this:</p>
<p><em>Liquid tungsten is so hot, if you dropped it into a lava flow, the lava
would freeze the tungsten.</em></p>
<p>Needless to say, if you set a boat on a sea of liquid tungsten, both you
and the boat would rapidly combust and be incinerated.</p>
<p><strong>Liquid nitrogen</strong> is very cold.</p>
<p>Liquid helium is colder, but they're both closer to absolute zero than
to the coldest temperatures in Antarctica, so to someone floating on
them in a boat, the temperature difference is not that significant.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/microeng/ln2.html">Dartmouth engineering page on liquid nitrogen
safety</a> includes the
following phrases:</p>
<ul>
<li>"violent reactions with organic materials"</li>
<li>"it will explode"</li>
<li>"displace oxygen in the room"</li>
<li>"severe clothing fire"</li>
<li>"suffocation without warning"</li>
</ul>
<p>Liquid nitrogen has a density similar to that of water, so a rowboat
would float on it, but if you were in it, you wouldn't survive for long.</p>
<p>If the air above the nitrogen was room temperature when you started, it
would cool rapidly, and you and the boat would be smothered in a thick
fog as the water condensed out of the air. (This is the same effect that
causes steam when you pour out liquid nitrogen.) The condensation would
freeze, quickly covering your boat in a layer of frost.</p>
<p>The warm air would cause the nitrogen on the surface to evaporate. This
would displace the oxygen over the lake, causing you to asphyxiate.</p>
<p>If the air (or the nitrogen) were both cold enough to avoid evaporation,
you would instead develop hypothermia and die of exposure.</p>
<p><strong>Liquid helium</strong> would be worse.</p>
<p>For one thing, it's only about one-eighth as dense as water, so your
boat would have to be eight times larger to support a given weight.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="Frankly, what they needed was a smaller shark." src="/imgs/a/50/boat_large.png">
<p>But helium has a trick. When cooled below about two degrees kelvin, it
becomes a superfluid, which has the odd property that it crawls up and
over the walls of containers by capillary forces.</p>
<p>It crawls along at about 20 centimeters per second, so it would take the
liquid helium less than 30 seconds to start collecting in the bottom of
your boat.</p>
<p>This would, as in the liquid nitrogen scenario, cause rapid death from
hypothermia.</p>
<p>If it's any consolation, as you lay dying, you would be able to observe
an odd phenomenon.</p>
<p>Superfluid helium films, like the one rapidly covering you, carry the
same types of ordinary sound waves that most materials do. But they also
exhibit an additional type of wave, a slow-moving ripple that propogates
along thin films of helium. It's only observed in superfluids, and has
the mysterious and poetic name "<a href="http://www.physics.berkeley.edu/research/packard/current_research/schechter's%20web/page2.html">third
sound</a>."</p>
<p>Your eardrums may no longer function, and wouldn't be able to detect
this type of vibration anyway, but as you froze to death in the floor of
a giant boat, your ears would be filled—literally—with a sound no human
can ever hear: The third sound.</p>
<p>And that, at least, is pretty cool.</p>
