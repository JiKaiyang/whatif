  <p id="question">What if a glass of water was, all of a sudden, literally half empty?</p>
<p id="attribute">—Vittorio Iacovella</p>
<p>The pessimist is probably more right about how it turns out than the
optimist.</p>
<p>When people say “glass half empty”, they usually mean something like a glass containing equal parts water and air:</p>
<img class="illustration" title="an optimist and pessimist sitting at a table with a half-full - or half-empty glass between them. the optimist's thought bubble reads 'ooh-water! i bet we'll get to drink it!' while the pessimist's thought bubble reads 'drinking fluids postpones death but doesn't avert it.'png:" src="/imgs/a/6/glass_people.png">
<p>Traditionally, the optimist sees the glass as half full while the
pessimist sees it as half empty. This has spawned a zillion joke
variants—e.g., the engineer sees a glass that’s twice as big as it needs
to be, the surrealist sees a giraffe eating a necktie, etc.</p>
<p>But what if the empty half of the glass were <em>actually</em> empty—a vacuum?
(Even a vacuum arguably isn’t truly empty, but that’s a question for
quantum semantics.)</p>
<p>The vacuum would definitely not last long. But exactly what happens
depends on a key question that nobody usually bothers to ask: <em>Which</em>
half is empty?</p>
<p>For our scenario, we’ll imagine three different half-empty glasses, and
follow what happens to them microsecond by microsecond.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="three half-empty glasses of waterpng:" src="/imgs/a/6/glass_three.png">
<p>In the middle is the traditional air/water glass. On the right is a
glass like the traditional one, except the air is replaced by a vacuum.
The glass on the left is half full of water and half empty—but it’s the
<em>bottom</em> half that’s empty.</p>
<p>We’ll imagine the vacuums appear at time <strong>t</strong>=0.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="three half-empty glasses of water at t=0png:" src="/imgs/a/6/glass_0s.png">
<p>For the first handful of microseconds, nothing happens. On this
timescale, even the air molecules are nearly stationary.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="three half-empty glasses of water at t=50uspng:" src="/imgs/a/6/glass_50ns.png">
<p>For the most part, air molecules jiggle around at speeds of a few
hundred meters per second. But at any given time, some happen to be
moving faster than others. The fastest few are moving at over 1000
meters per second. These are the first to drift into the vacuum in the
glass on the right.</p>
<p>The vacuum on the left is surrounded by barriers, so air molecules can’t
easily get in. The water, being a liquid, doesn’t expand to fill the
vacuum in the same way air does. However, in the vacuum of the glasses,
it does start to boil, slowly shedding water vapor into the empty space.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="three half-empty glasses at t=150uspng:" src="/imgs/a/6/glass_150ns.png">
<p>While the water on the surface in both glasses starts to boil away, in
the glass on the right, the air rushing in stops it before it really
gets going. The glass on the left continues to fill with a very faint
mist of water vapor.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="three half-empthy glasses at t=400uspng:" src="/imgs/a/6/glass_400ns.png">
<p>After a few hundred microseconds, the air rushing into the glass on the
right fills the vacuum completely and rams into the surface of the
water, sending a pressure wave through the liquid. The sides of the
glass bulge slightly, but they contain the pressure and do not break. A
shockwave reverberates through the water and back into the air, joining
the turbulence already there.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="three half-empty glasses at t=1mspng:" src="/imgs/a/6/glass_1ms.png">
<p>The shockwave from the vacuum collapse takes about a millisecond to
spread out through the other two glasses. The glass and water both flex
slightly as the wave passes through them. In a few more milliseconds, it
reaches the humans’ ears as a loud bang.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="three half-empty glasses at t=2mspng:" src="/imgs/a/6/glass_2ms.png">
<p>Around this time, the glass on the left starts to visibly lift into the
air.</p>
<p>The air pressure is trying to squeeze the glass and water together. This
is the force we think of as suction. The vacuum on the right didn’t last
long enough for the suction to lift the glass, but since air can’t get
into the vacuum on the left, the glass and the water begin to slide
toward each other.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="three half-empty glasses at t=5mspng:" src="/imgs/a/6/glass_5ms.png">
<p>The boiling water has filled the vacuum with a very small amount of
water vapor. As the space gets smaller, the buildup of water vapor
slowly increases the pressure on the water’s surface. Eventually, this
will slow the boiling, just like higher air pressure would.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="three half-empty glasses at t=8mspng:" src="/imgs/a/6/glass_8ms.png">
<p>However, the glass and water are now moving too fast for the vapor
buildup to matter. Less than ten milliseconds after the clock started,
they’re flying toward each other at several meters per second. Without a
cushion of air between them—only a few wisps of vapor—the water smacks
into the bottom of the glass like a hammer.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="three half-empty glasses at t=10mspng:" src="/imgs/a/6/glass_10ms.png">
<p>Water is very nearly incompressible, so the impact isn’t spread out—it
comes as a single sharp shock. The momentary force on the glass is
immense, and it breaks.</p>
<p>This “water hammer” effect (which is also responsible for the “clunk”
you sometimes hear in old plumbing when you turn off the faucet) can be
seen in the well-known party trick (recorded on Mythbusters, analyzed in
physics classes, and demonstrated in countless student dorms) of
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77gWkl0ZUC8">smacking the top of a glass bottle to blow out the
bottom.</a></p>
<p>When the bottle is struck, it’s pushed suddenly downward. The liquid
inside doesn’t respond to the suction (air pressure) right away—much
like in our scenario—and a gap briefly opens up. It’s a small vacuum—a
few fractions of an inch thick—but when it closes, the shock breaks the
bottom of the bottle.</p>
<p>In our situation, the forces would be more than enough to destroy even
the heaviest drinking glasses.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="three half-empty glasses at t=20mspng:" src="/imgs/a/6/glass_20ms.png">
<p>The bottom is carried downward by the water and thunks against the
table. The water splashes around it, spraying droplets and glass shards
in all directions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the detached upper portion of the glass continues to rise.</p>

<p>After half a second, the observers, hearing a pop, have begun to flinch.
Their heads lift involuntarily to follow the rising movement of the
glass.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="two half-empty glasses on the table at t=1s, the third glass breaking into fragments png:" src="/imgs/a/6/glass_1s.png">
<p>The glass has just enough speed to bang against the ceiling, breaking
into fragments…</p>
<img class="illustration" title="two half-empty glasses on the table at t=1.5s, the third glass now a mass of fragments raining down from the ceiling.png:" src="/imgs/a/6/glass_1_5s.png">
<p>… which, their momentum now spent, return to the table.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="two half-empty glasses on the table at t=10s, the third now embedded in the faces of the optimist ('Hey, free glass!') and pessimist ('Aaaaaaa')png:" src="/imgs/a/6/glass_10s.png">
<p>The lesson: If the optimist says the glass is half full, and the
pessimist says the glass is half empty, the physicist ducks.</p>
