<p>Before we go any further, I want to emphasize something:</p>
<p><strong>I am not an authority on lightning safety.</strong> I am a guy who draws
pictures on the internet. I like when things catch fire and explode,
which means I do not have your best interests in mind. The authorities
on lightning safety are the folks at the US National Weather Service:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/"></a><a href="http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/">http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/</a></p>
<p>Ok. With that out of the way ...</p>
<p>To answer these questions, we need to get an idea of where lightning is
likely to go. There’s a cool trick for this, and I’ll give it away right
here at the start: Roll an imaginary 60-meter sphere across the
landscape and look at where it touches.</p>
<p>They say lightning strikes the tallest thing around. That’s the kind of
maddeningly inexact statement that immediately sparks all kinds of
questions. How far is “around”? I mean, not all lightning hits Mt.
Everest. But does it find the tallest person in a crowd? The tallest
person I know is probably Ryan North (paleontologists estimate he stood
nearly five meters tall at the shoulder). Should I try to hang around
him for lightning safety reasons? What about other reasons? (This is
probably why you people ask the questions on this blog, not me.)</p>
<p>But how <em>does</em> lightning pick its targets?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1mB5rM8WHU">This video</a>, captured by
Tom A. Warner, might be the single coolest piece of footage I’ve ever
seen. It shows a bolt of lightning recorded at 7,207 frames per second.
The 33-second video represents barely a tenth of a second of real time.
There are lots of slow-motion videos of lightning, but this is by far
the best I’ve found.</p>
<p>Tom’s video gives an idea of how lightning moves. It starts with a
branching bundle of charge—the “leader”—descending from the cloud. This
is what you see in the first part of the video. It spreads downward at
speeds of tens to hundreds of kilometers per second, covering the few
kilometers to the ground in a few dozen milliseconds.</p>
<p>The leader carries comparatively little current—on the order of 200
amps. That’s still enough to kill you, but it’s nothing compared to what
happens next. Once the leader makes contact with the ground, the cloud
and the ground equalize with a massive discharge of more like 20,000
amps. This is the blinding flash you see. It races back up the channel
at a significant fraction of the speed of light, covering the distance
in under a millisecond—all within a single frame of that video.</p>
<p>(Technical detail: while it’s called a “return stroke”, charge is still
flowing downward. However, the discharge appears to propagate upward.
This effect similar to how when a traffic light turns green, or
<a href="http://xkcd.com/1116/">whatever</a> color, the cars in front start moving,
then the cars in back, so the movement appears to spread backward.)</p>
<p>So the place on the ground where we see a bolt “strike” is the spot
where the leader first makes contact with the surface. The leader moves
down through the air in little jumps. It’s ultimately feeling its way
toward the (usually) positive charge in the ground. However, it only
“feels” charges within a few tens of meters of the tip. If there’s
something connected to the ground within that distance, the bolt will
jump to it. Otherwise, it jumps out in a semi-random direction and
repeats the process.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="lightning makes a series of steps down toward ryan north" src="/imgs/a/16/lightning_steps.png">
<p>This is where the 60-meter sphere comes in. It’s a way to imagine what
spots might be the first thing the leader senses—the places it might
jump to in its next (final) step.</p>
<p>To figure out where lightning is likely to hit, you roll the imaginary
60-meter sphere across the landscape (for safety reasons, do not use a
real sphere). This sphere climbs up over trees and buildings without
passing through anything (or rolling it up). Places the surface makes
contact—treetops, fenceposts, and golfers in fields—are potential
lightning targets.</p>
<p>This means you can calculate a lightning “shadow” around an object of
height h on a flat surface.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="a sphere of radius 30 meters rests on the ground next to a man on a platform with a flag" src="/imgs/a/16/lightning_shadow.png">
<p>The shadow is the area where the leader is likely to hit the tall object
instead of the ground around it:</p>
<p>\[\text{Shadow Radius}=\sqrt{-h(h-2r)}\]</p>
<p>Now, that doesn’t mean you’re <em>safe</em> on the ground around it—often, it
means the opposite. After the current hits the tall object, it flows out
into the ground. If you’re touching the ground nearby, it can travel
through your body. Of the 28 people killed by lightning so far this
year, <a href="http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/fatalities.htm">13 were standing under or near
trees</a>.</p>
<p>With all this in mind, let’s look at possible lightning paths for the
scenarios in the questions.</p>
<p><em>How dangerous is it, really, to be in a pool during a thunderstorm?</em></p>
<p>Pretty dangerous. Water is conductive, but that’s not the biggest
problem—the biggest problem is that if you’re swimming, your head is
poking up from a large flat surface. But lightning striking the water
near you would still be bad. The 20,000 amps spread outward—<a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/earth/dwyer-lightning.html">mostly over
the
surface</a>—but
how much of a jolt it will give you at what distance is hard to
calculate</p>
<p>My guess is that you’d be in significant danger anywhere within a
minimum of a dozen meters—and further in fresh water, because the
current will be happier to take a shortcut through you.</p>
<p><em>What would happen if you were taking a shower when you were struck by
lightning? Or standing under a waterfall?</em></p>
<img class="illustration" title="lightning strikes two people, one standing in an inside waterfall and one standing in an outside waterfall" src="/imgs/a/16/lightning_shower.png">
<p>You’re not in danger from the spray—it’s just a bunch of droplets of
water in the air. It’s the tub under your feet, and the puddle of water
in contact with the plumbing, that’s the real threat.</p>
<p><em>What would happen if you were in a boat or a plane that got hit by
lightning? Or a submarine?</em></p>
<img class="illustration" title="lightning hits a boat, another boat, and a plane. it does not hit the submarine because the ocean is in the way." src="/imgs/a/16/lightning_boat.png">
<p>A boat without a cabin is about as safe as a golf course. A boat with a
closed cabin and a lightning protection system is about as safe as a
car. A submarine is about as safe as a submarine safe (a submarine safe
is not to be confused with a safe in a submarine—a safe in a submarine
is substantially safer than a submarine safe).</p>
<p><em>What if you were changing the light at the top of a radio tower and
lightning struck? Or what if you were doing a backflip? Or standing in a
graphite field? Or looking straight up at the bolt?</em></p>
<img class="illustration" title="lightning strikes a person on a tower, then flows into the tower to the ground. another bolt passes through someone doing a backflip. a person stands in a graphite field (?). a person looks at a lightning bolt which is hitting them in the eyes." src="/imgs/a/16/lightning_graphite.png">
<p><em>What would happen if lightning struck a bullet in midair?</em></p>
<p>The bullet won't affect the path the lightning takes. You'd have somehow
to time the shot so the bullet was in the middle of the bolt when the
return stroke happened.</p>
<p>The core of a lightning bolt is a <a href="http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/1968/JB073i006p01889.shtml">few centimeters in
diameter</a>.
A bullet fired from an AK-47 is about 26 mm long and moves at about 700
millimeters every millisecond.</p>
<p>The bullet has a copper coating over a lead core. Copper is a
fantastically good conductor of electricity, and much of the 20,000 amps
could easily take a shortcut through the bullet.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="a bullet passes through the ionized channel of a lightning bolt. as it reaches the center, it glows very brightly. it is still going brightly as the bullet exits undamaged." src="/imgs/a/16/lightning_bullet.png">
<p>Surprisingly, the bullet handles it pretty well. If it were sitting
still, the current would quickly heat and melt the metal. But it’s
moving along so quickly that it exits the channel before it can be
warmed by more than a few degrees. It continues on to its target
relatively unaffected. There are some curious electromagnetic forces
created by the magnetic field around the bolt and the current flow
through the bullet, but none of the ones I examined changed the overall
picture very much.</p>

hit by lightning?</em></p>
