  <p id="question">How hard would a puck have to be shot to be able to knock the goalie himself backwards into the net?</p>
<p id="attribute">—Tom</p>
<p>This can’t really happen.</p>
<p>It’s not just a problem of hitting it hard enough. This blog <a href="http://what-if.xkcd.com/1/">isn’t
concerned</a> with that kind of limitation.
Humans with sticks can’t make a puck go much faster than <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/khl-alexander-ryazantsev-sets-world-record-hardest-shot-174131642.html">about 50
meters per
second</a>,
so we’ll assume this puck is launched by a <a href="http://hockeyrobotics.com/">hockey
robot</a> or an <a href="http://www.psfc.mit.edu/~radovinsky/papers/32.pdf">electric
sled</a> or a
<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/wstf/laboratories/hypervelocity/gasguns.html">hypersonic light gas
gun</a>.</p>
<p>The problem, in a nutshell, is that hockey players are heavy and pucks are not. A goalie in full gear outweighs a puck by a factor of about 600. Even the fastest slap shot has less momentum than a ten-year-old skating along at a mile per hour.</p>
<p>Hockey players also can brace pretty hard against the ice. A player
skating at full speed can stop in the space of a few meters, which means
the force they’re exerting on the ice is pretty substantial. (It also
suggests that if you started to slowly tilt a hockey rink, it could get
up to 50 degrees before the players would all slide to one end. Clearly,
experiments are needed to confirm this.)</p>
<p>From estimates of collision speeds in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWj6--Cf9QA">hockey
videos</a>, and some guidance
from a hockey player friend, I estimated that the 165-gram puck would
have to be moving somewhere between Mach 2 and Mach 8 to knock the
goalie backward into the goal—faster if the goalie is bracing against
the hit, and slower if the puck hits at an upward angle.</p>
<p>Firing an object at Mach 8 is not, in itself, very hard. One of the best
methods for doing so is the aforementioned <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/wstf/laboratories/hypervelocity/gasguns.html">hypersonic gas
gun</a>,
which is—at its core—the same mechanism a BB gun uses to fire BBs.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="and world peace, which i recognize my first request makes significantly less likely" src="/imgs/a/39/goalie_bb_gun.png">
<p>But a hockey puck moving at Mach 8 will have a lot of problems. It’s not
on the same scale as a relativistic baseball, but the air ahead of the
puck would be compressed and heated very rapidly. It wouldn’t be going
fast enough to ionize the air and leave a glowing trail like a meteor,
but the surface of the puck would (given enough time) start to melt or
char.</p>
<p>The air resistance, however, will slow the puck down very quickly, so a
puck going at Mach 8 when it leaves the launcher might be going a
fraction of that when it arrives at the goal. And even at Mach 8, the
puck probably wouldn’t pass through the goalie’s body. Instead, it would
burst apart on impact with the power of a large firecracker or small
stick of dynamite.</p>
<p>If you’re like me, when you first saw this question, you might’ve
imagined the puck leaving a cartoon-style hockey-puck-shaped hole. But
that’s because our intuitions are shaky about how materials react at
very high speeds.</p>
<p>Instead, a different mental picture might be more accurate: Imagine
throwing a ripe tomato—as hard as you can—at a cake.</p>

<p>That’s about what would happen.</p>
