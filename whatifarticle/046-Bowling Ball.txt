  <p id="question">I've been told that if the Earth were shrunk down to the size of a bowling ball, it would be smoother than said bowling ball. My question is, what would a bowling ball look like if it were blown up to the size of the Earth?</p>

<p>A good, professional-quality bowling ball is smoother than the Earth.</p>
<p>Phil Plait, of Bad Astronomy, took a look at the claim that the Earth
was smoother than a billiard ball. He <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/09/08/ten-things-you-dont-know-about-the-earth/#.UZrBpmRAC9a">concluded that the Earth was
smoother but less
round</a>,
based on published billiard ball roundness tolerances. However, he
couldn’t find any information on the size and shape of a billiard ball’s
pits and bumps.</p>
<p>Fortunately for us, there are people who <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5V3rFdAIMY">digitally scan bowling ball
surfaces</a>.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="I digitally scan bowling ball surfaces and I vote." src="/imgs/a/46/bowling_scan.png">
<p>These scans (along with various measurements of ball
roughness<sup><a href="http://classic.bowl.com/news/specsandcerts/index.jsp">[1]</a></sup>
tell us that a high-end bowling ball is quite smooth. If blown up to the
scale of the Earth, the ridges and
bumps<sup><a href="http://www.itbca.bowlingknowledge.info/index.php/winter-2013/85-bowling-ball-shell-chemistry-101">[2]</a></sup> would
be between 10 and 200 meters high, and the peaks would be between one
and three kilometers apart:</p>
<img class="illustration" title="If you rolled a bowling ball down one of those hills, that would be pretty meta." src="/imgs/a/46/bowling_texture.png">
<p>By Earth standards, this is quite smooth; our highest mountains are 40
times higher.</p>
<p>What would this bowling ball world (we’ll call it “Lebowski”) be like?</p>
<p>For starters, bowling balls are a lot less dense than rock, so
Lebowski’s surface gravity would be a quarter the strength of Earth’s:</p>
<img class="illustration" title="Maybe you can also do this on Earth. I don’t want to try." src="/imgs/a/46/bowling_throw.png">
<p>It would also (at first) have no atmosphere.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="You’re out of your element." src="/imgs/a/46/bowling_dead.png">
<p>The finger holes would be about a thousand kilometers across and a few
thousand kilometers deep.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="A hole in the world." src="/imgs/a/46/bowling_holes.png">
<p>On Earth, holes this big would expose the molten interior. But Lebowski
doesn’t have a molten interior.</p>
<p>The Earth’s core is hot for two reasons: It’s still glowing from the
heat of all the dust collapsing together when it formed, and it’s full
of radioactive metals. Lebowski wouldn’t have either of these, so its
core would start out cold.</p>
<p>The holes would be far too big to hold themselves open against gravity;
On that scale, the polymers in the bowling ball would behave more like a
liquid. In the space of about half an hour, the holes would undergo a
slow-motion collapse.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="This is no longer, by any stretch of the imagination, a regulation ball." src="/imgs/a/46/bowling_holes_collapse.png">
<p>As they collapsed, the material around the holes would heat to a glow.
At the center of the hole, a white-hot jet of charred hydrocarbons would
fountain outward into space.</p>
<p>When it was over, Lebowski would be left with massive scars, each
marking the location where an abyss collapsed to form a molten sea.</p>

<p>And now, thanks to this question, whenever I look at the Moon, I’ll
notice <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FFile%3AMoon_names.svg&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHIe4YcJnAZYmMY278G3Ko63hJnKQ">the Sea of Tranquility, the Sea of Serenity, and the Sea of
Crisis</a>,
and I’ll think: <em>Finger holes.</em></p>
<p>But that’s just, like, my opinion, man.</p>
