  <p id="question">Let's assume there's life on the the nearest habitable exoplanet and that they have technology comparable to ours. If they looked at our star right now, what would they see?</p>

<p>Answer:</p>
<img class="illustration" title="a pale yellow dot" src="/imgs/a/47/life_dot.png">
<p>Let’s try a more complete answer. We’ll start with ...</p>
<p><strong>Radio transmissions</strong></p>
<p><em>Contact</em> popularized the idea of aliens listening in on our
transmissions. Sadly, the odds are against it.</p>
<p>Here’s the problem: Space is big. Really
big.<sup><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11.The_Hitchhiker_s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>You can work through the physics of interstellar radio attenuation, but
the problem is captured pretty well by considering the economics of the
situation: If your TV signals are getting to another star, you’re losing
money. Powering a transmitter is expensive, and creatures on other stars
aren’t buying the products in the TV commercials that pay your
electricity bill.</p>
<p>The full picture is more complicated, but the bottom line is that as our
technology has advanced, less of our radio traffic has been leaking out
into space. We’re closing down the giant transmitting antennas and
switching to cable and fiber and tightly-focused cell-tower
networks.<sup><a href="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/1007/1007.0850v1.pdf">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>While our TV signals may have been detectable—with great effort—for a
while,<sup><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0610377v2.pdf">[3]</a></sup> that window
is closing. In the late 20th century, when we were using TV and radio to
scream into the void at the top of our lungs, the signal probably faded
to undetectability after a few
light-years.<sup><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/earth-as-a-distant-planet-a-rosetta-stone-for-the-search-of-earth-like-worlds/oclc/643269627">[4]</a></sup> The
potentially habitable exoplanets we’ve spotted so far are dozens of
light-years away, so the odds are they aren’t currently <a href="http://xkcd.com/1212/">repeating our
catchphrases</a>.</p>
<p>But TV and radio transmissions still weren’t Earth’s most powerful radio
signal. They were outshone by the beams from early-warning
radar.<sup><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/earth-as-a-distant-planet-a-rosetta-stone-for-the-search-of-earth-like-worlds/oclc/643269627">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Early-warning radar, a product of the Cold War, consisted of a bunch of
ground and airborne stations scattered around the Arctic. These stations
swept the atmosphere with powerful radar beams 24/7, often bouncing them
off the ionosphere, and people obsessively monitored the echos for any
hints of enemy movement. (I wasn’t alive during most of this period, but
from what I hear, the mood was a little tense.)</p>
<p>These radar transmissions leaked into space, and could probably be
picked up by nearby
exoplanets<sup><a href="http://www.astrobio.net/exclusive/4847/seti-on-the-ska">[5]</a></sup> if
they happened to be listening when the beam swept over their part of the
sky. But the same march of technological progress that made the TV
broadcast towers obsolete has had the same effect on early-warning
radar. Today’s systems—where they exist at all—are much quieter, and may
eventually be replaced completely by new technology.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="&lt;enemy frantically clicks to report account as spam&gt;" src="/imgs/a/47/life_twitter.png">
<p>Earth’s most <em>powerful</em> radio signal is the beam from the Arecibo
telescope. This massive dish in Puerto Rico can function as a radar
transmitter, bouncing a signal off nearby targets like Mercury and the
asteroid belt. It’s essentially a flashlight which we shine on planets
to see them better. (This is just as crazy as it sounds.)</p>
<p>But it transmits only occasionally, and in a narrow beam. If an
exoplanet happened to be caught in the beam, and they were lucky enough
to be pointing a receiving antenna at our corner of the sky at the time,
all they would pick up would be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wow!_signal">a brief pulse of radio energy, then
silence</a>.</p>
<p>So hypothetical aliens looking at Earth probably wouldn’t pick us up
with radio antennas.</p>
<p>But there’s also ...</p>
<p><strong>Visible light</strong></p>
<p>This is more promising. The Sun is really
bright <sup>[<span style="color:#0645ad; font-style:italic; font-weight: bold;font-family: sans-serif;"><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site:craigslist.org+chevrolet+citation">citation needed</a></span>]</sup> and its light illuminates the
Earth.<sup>[<span style="color:#0645ad; font-style:italic; font-weight: bold;font-family: sans-serif;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation_(horse)">citation needed</a></span>]</sup> Some
of that light is reflected back into space as “Earthshine”. Some of it
skims close to our planet and passes through our atmosphere before
continuing on to the stars. Both of these effects could potentially be
detected from an
exoplanet.<sup><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/earth-as-a-distant-planet-a-rosetta-stone-for-the-search-of-earth-like-worlds/oclc/6432">[4]</a></sup><sup><a href="http://planetimager.org/">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>They wouldn’t tell you anything about humans directly, but if you
watched the Earth for long enough, you could figure out a lot about our
atmosphere from the reflectivity. You could probably figure out what our
water cycle looked like, and our oxygen-rich atmosphere would give you a
hint that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Oxygenation_Event">something weird was going
on</a>.</p>
<p>So in the end, the clearest signal from Earth might not be from us at
all. It might be from the algae that have been terraforming the
planet—and altering the signals we send into space—for billions of
years.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="Heeeey, look at the time. Gotta run." src="/imgs/a/47/life_humans.png">
<p>Of course, if we wanted to send a clearer signal, we could. A radio
transmission has the problem that they have to be paying attention when
it arrives.</p>
<p>Instead, we could <em>make</em> them pay attention. With ion drives, nuclear
pulse propulsion, or just clever use of gravitational slingshots, we
could probably send a probe out of the Solar System fast enough to reach
a given nearby star in a few dozen millennia. If we can figure out how
to make a guidance system that survives the trip (which would be tough)
we could use it to steer toward any inhabited planet.</p>
<p>To land safely, we’d have to slow down. But slowing down takes even more
fuel. And, hey, the whole point of this was for them to notice us,
right?</p>
<p>So maybe if those aliens looked toward our Solar System, this is what
they’d see:</p>
