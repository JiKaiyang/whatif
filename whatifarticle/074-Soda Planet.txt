  <p id="question">How much of the Earth's currently-existing water has ever been turned into a soft drink at some point in its history?</p>
<p id="attribute">Brian Roelofs</p>
<p>0.0000005%.</p>
<p>First, a tiny bit of background: In the beverage industry, "soft drink" technically refers to any non-alcoholic packaged beverage, but it's commonly used to mean <em>carbonated</em> beverages.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[1]</span><span class="refbody">In the US, the word people use to refer to a generic carbonated beverage—"soda" vs. "pop" vs. "coke"—strongly depends on <a href="http://www.popvssoda.com/">where they live</a>.</span></span> Carbonated water was first produced in the 1700s, and gained popularity as "tonic water" (carbonated water mixed with quinine powder, which has anti-malaria properties), and in carbonated lemonade.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[2]</span><span class="refbody">Shahan Cheong, <a href="http://scheong.wordpress.com/2011/03/27/taking-the-waters-the-history-of-the-modern-soft-drink/">Taking the Waters: The History of the Modern Soft-Drink</a>, <strong>Not Yet Published</strong> (blog post)</span></span></p>
<p><strong>The vast majority of all soft drinks ever consumed have been consumed in the last 40 years.</strong> Carbonated beverages were fairly popular in the industrialized world throughout the 20th century, but population growth and the spread of companies like Coca-Cola into the developing world mean that the total soda consumption per year has grown relatively fast.</p>
<p>Total soft drink consumption in 2013 was about 188 billion liters. That's 26 liters per person annually, or 70 mL/day.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[3]</span><span class="refbody">MarketLine, <a href="http://www.reportlinker.com/p0171897-summary/Carbonated-Soft-Drinks-Global-Industry-Guide.html">Carbonated Soft Drinks: Global Industry Guide</a></span></span> (In the US, the average was 170 liters, or about one 16-oz drink per person per day<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[4]</span><span class="refbody">Dan Check, Matt Dodson, and Chris Kirk, <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/map_of_the_week/2012/07/map_of_soda_consumption_americans_drink_more_than_anyone_else_.html">Americans Drink More Soda Than Anyone Else</a> (slate.com)</span></span>).</p>
<img class="illustration" title="And each soda is a couple of Cadbury eggs." src="/imgs/a/74/soda_usworld.png">
<p>Over the past several centuries, humans have probably consumed about <strong>6.5 trillion liters of carbonated beverages</strong>.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[5]</span><span class="refbody">This is a ballpark guess based on population growth and some rough estimates of when soda-drinking became popular in different parts of the world.</span></span></p>
<p>That's a lot, certainly. For example, it's enough to fill every house and apartment in the US to a depth of 12 inches:</p>
<img class="illustration" title="BRB, searching Amazon for 'floor-length straw'." src="/imgs/a/74/soda_floor.png">
<p>Even if we assume that every soda is made from an entirely new batch of water, and doesn't include any water from previous sodas, it still represents a tiny fraction of the world's fresh water, and an even tinier fraction of the total volume of the oceans.</p>
<p>What if we expand the question to cover <em>all</em> drinking water? What percentage of water molecules have been drunk<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[6]</span><span class="refbody">Drank? Drinked? Drankéd?</span></span> by someone at some point?</p>
<p>Humans have been around for a few hundred thousand years, and the total number of humans who have ever lived is usually estimated to be around 110 billion. The question of how much water we <em>should</em> drink per day is the subject of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=glasses+of+water+per+day">furious debate</a>—the "8 glasses" thing seems to be a myth—but the amount of water we <em>actually</em> drink per day seems to be about a liter.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[7]</span><span class="refbody">EPA, <a href="http://water.epa.gov/action/advisories/drinking/upload/2005_05_06_criteria_drinking_percapita_2004.pdf">Estimated Per Capita Water Ingestion and Body Weight in the United States–An Update</a> (2004)</span></span> This amount varies a little depending on climate, but if we assume the average historical human drank a liter of water per day for 40 years,<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[8]</span><span class="refbody">This is a rough ballpark estimate; it's lower than the 70 or 80 years you might expect because we have to account for the changing human lifespans throughout history and the decreased water consumption by children.</span></span> then our species has drunk about <strong>100 trillion liters of water</strong> in total.</p>
<p>100 trillion liters (100 km<sup>3</sup>) is still very little compared to even the volume of all rivers (1,200 km<sup>3</sup>). This means that, since our drinking water passes through the water cycle and is quickly diluted by rivers and oceans, the majority of the water molecules we drink have never been drunk by any other human.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[9]</span><span class="refbody">On the other hand, it's just about guaranteed that <em>some</em> of the water molecules in any mouthful have been drunk by someone else.</span></span></p>
<p>But we're just one species.</p>
<p>Dinosaurs, as a taxonomic group, have been around<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[10]</span><span class="refbody">They're <a href="http://xkcd.com/1211/">still around</a>!</span></span> for 230 million years, but their heyday was the mid-to-late Jurassic period. In this period, there were probably around 5 trillion kilograms of dinosaur alive at any given time.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[11]</span><span class="refbody">Jerzy Trammer, "<a href="http://agp.org.pl/table/pdf/61-2/trammer.pdf">Differences in global biomass and energy use between dinosaurs and mammals</a>", <strong>Acta Geologica Polonica</strong>, Vol. 61 (2011), No. 2, pp. 125–132</span></span> (Today, there are probably only a few hundred billion kilograms of living dinosaur,<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[12]</span><span class="refbody">I haven't been able to find an estimate for total global bird biomass, but I'll take any chance to cite my favorite journal article ever: "<a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1018341530497">How Many Birds Are There?</a>", by Kevin J. Gaston and Tim M. Blackburn, which estimates the total number at about 300 billion. A <a href="http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/270/1521/1293.full.pdf">later paper</a> lowered the estimate to about 80 billion, so unless the average bird weighs 140 lbs, there is far less dinosaur in the world today than in the Jurassic.</span></span> 50 billion of it chicken).</p>
<p>If we assume Jurassic dinosaur water requirements were similar to mammal ones,<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[13]</span><span class="refbody"><a href="http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/wat/wq/reference/foodandwater.html">Animal weights and their food and water requirements</a></span></span> then this suggests dinosaurs drank something like <strong>10<sup>22</sup> or 10<sup>23</sup> liters of water</strong> during the Mesozoic era—more than the total volume of the oceans (10<sup>21</sup> liters).</p>
<p>The average "residence time" of water in the oceans—the amount of time a water molecule spends there before moving into another part of the water cycle—is about 3,000 years,<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[14]</span><span class="refbody">K. L. Schulz, <a href="http://www.esf.edu/efb/schulz/Limnology/hydrologic.html">Water in the Biosphere</a></span></span> and no part of the water cycle traps water for more than a few hundred thousand years. This means we can assume that, over timescales of millions of years, Earth's water is thoroughly mixed—and dinosaurs had plenty of time to drink it all many times over.</p>
<p>This means that while the chances are that most of the water in your soda has never been in another soda, almost all of it has been drunk by at least one dinosaur.</p>
