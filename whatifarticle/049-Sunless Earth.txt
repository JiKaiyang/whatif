  <p id="question">What would happen to the Earth if the Sun suddenly switched off?</p>
<p id="attribute">—Many, many readers</p>
<p>This is probably the single most popular question submitted to <em>What
If</em>.</p>
<p>Part of why I haven’t answered it is that it's been answered already. A
Google search for <em><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=what+if+the+Sun+went+out">what if the Sun went
out</a></em> turns up
a lot of excellent articles thoroughly analyzing the situation.</p>
<p>However, since my recent articles on sunsets, the rate of submission of
this question has risen even further, so I’ve decided to do my best to
answer it.</p>
<p><strong>If the Sun went out ...</strong></p>

<p>We won’t worry about exactly how it happens. We'll just assume we
figured out a way to fast-forward the Sun through its evolution so that
it becomes a cold, inert sphere. What would the consequences be for us
here on Earth?</p>
<p>Let's look at a few:</p>
<p><strong>Reduced risk of solar flares:</strong> In 1859, a massive solar flare and
geomagnetic storm hit the
Earth.<sup><a href="http://www.leif.org/research/1859%20Storm%20-%20Extreme%20Space%20Weather.pdf">[1]</a></sup> Magnetic storms induce electric currents in wires. Unfortunately for us, by 1859
we had wrapped the Earth in telegraph wires. The storm caused powerful
currents in those wires, knocking out communications and in some cases
causing telegraph equipment to catch
fire.<sup><a href="http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/8787/1/02-1310.pdf">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Since 1859, we've wrapped the Earth in a lot more wires. If the 1859
storm hit us today, the Department of Homeland Security estimates the
economic damage to the US alone would be several trillion
dollars<sup><a href="http://www.oecd.org/governance/risk/46891645.pdf">[3]</a></sup>—more
than every hurricane which has ever hit the US
<em>combined</em>.<sup><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fsciencepolicy.colorado.edu%2Fadmin%2Fpublication_files%2Fresource-2476-2008.02.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFnOWO7P0PV6qJSPhUUf56glVwZKQ">[4]</a></sup> If
the Sun went out, this threat would be eliminated.</p>
<p><strong>Improved satellite service: </strong>When a communications satellite passes
in front of the Sun, the Sun can drown out the satellite's radio signal,
causing an interruption in service.<sup><a href="http://www3.alcatel-lucent.com/bstj/vol49-1970/articles/bstj49-8-1943.pdf">[5]</a></sup> Deactivating the Sun would solve this problem.</p>
<p><strong>Better astronomy:</strong> Without the Sun, ground-based observatories would
be able to operate around the clock. The cooler air would create less
atmospheric noise, which would reduce the load on adaptive optics
systems and allow for sharper images.</p>
<p><strong>Stable dust:</strong> Without sunlight, there would be no <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poynting%E2%80%93Robertson_effect">Poynting–Robertson
drag</a>,
which means we would finally be able to place dust into a stable orbit
around the Sun without the orbits decaying. I’m not sure whether anyone
wants to do that, but you never know.</p>
<p><strong>Reduced infrastructure costs:</strong> The Department of Transportation
estimates that it would cost $20 billion per year over the next 20
years to repair and maintain all US
bridges.<sup><a href="http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policy/2010cpr/chap7.htm#9">[6]</a></sup> Most
US bridges are over water; without the Sun, we could save money by
simply driving on a strip of asphalt laid across the ice.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="It doesn't matter how thin the ice is when there's no cavity under it to fall into." src="/imgs/a/49/sunless_bridges.png">
<p><strong>Cheaper trade:</strong> Time zones make trade more expensive; it's harder to
do business with someone if their office hours don't overlap with
yours.<sup><a href="http://eeecon.uibk.ac.at/wopec2/repec/inn/wpaper/2012-14.pdf">[7]</a></sup> If
the Sun went out, it would eliminate the need for time zones, allowing
us to switch to UTC and give a boost to the global economy.</p>
<p><strong>Safer Children:</strong> According to the North Dakota Department of Health,
babies younger than six months should be kept out of direct
sunlight.<sup><a href="http://www.ndhealth.gov/familyhealth/mch/babyfacts/Sunburn.pdf">[8]</a></sup> Without
sunlight, our children would be safer.</p>
<p><strong>Safer combat pilots:</strong> Many people sneeze when exposed to bright
sunlight. The reasons for this reflex are unknown, and it may pose a
danger to fighter pilots during
flight.<sup><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8108024">[9]</a></sup> If the Sun
went dark, it would mitigate this danger to our pilots.</p>
<p><strong>Safer parsnip:</strong> Wild parsnip is a surprisingly nasty plant. Its
leaves contain chemicals called furocoumarins, which can be absorbed by
human skin without causing symptoms ... at first. However, when the skin
is then exposed to sunlight (even days or weeks later), the
furocoumarins cause a nasty chemical burn. This is called
phytophotodermatitis.<sup><a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/wnrmag/html/stories/1999/jun99/parsnip.htm">[10]</a></sup> A darkened Sun would liberate us from the parsnip threat.</p>

<p>In conclusion, if the Sun went out, we would see a variety of benefits
across many areas of our lives.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any downsides to this scenario?</strong></p>
<p>We would all freeze and die.</p>
