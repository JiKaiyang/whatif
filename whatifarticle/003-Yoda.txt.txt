  <p id="question">How much Force power can Yoda output?</p>

<p>I’m going to—of course—ignore the prequels.</p>
<p>There’s a great SMBC comic
<a href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&amp;id=2305#comic">exploring</a>
the geopolitical consequences of having Superman turn a crank to provide
an unlimited source of energy. We could imagine Yoda using the Force to
run a similar generator. But how much power could he really supply?</p>
<p>Yoda’s greatest display of raw power in the original trilogy came when
he lifted Luke’s X-Wing from the swamp. As far as physically moving
objects around goes, this was easily the biggest expenditure of energy
through the Force we saw from anyone in the trilogy.</p>
<p>The energy it takes to lift an object to height <em>h</em> is equal to the
object’s mass times the force of gravity times the height it’s lifted.
The X-Wing scene lets us use this to put a lower limit on Yoda's peak
power output.</p>
<p>First we need to know how heavy the ship was. The X-Wing’s mass has
never been canonically established, but its length has—12.5 meters. An
F-22 is 19 meters long and weighs 19,700 kg, so scaling down from this
gives an estimate for the X-Wing of about 12,000 lbs (5 metric tons).</p>
<img class="illustration" title="illustration of an X-Wing and F-22" src="/imgs/a/3/02.png">
<p>\[m_{x} = m_{f22} \times \left(\frac{12.5}{19}\right)^{3} \approx 5,600\mathrm{kg}\]</p>
<p>Next, we need to know how fast it was rising. I went over footage of the
scene and timed the X-Wing's rate of ascent as it was emerging from the
water.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="character watching star wars for scientific research" src="/imgs/a/3/04.png">
<p>The front landing strut rises out of the water in about three and a half
seconds, and I estimated the strut to be 1.4 meters long (based on a
scene in <em>A New Hope</em> where a crew member squeezes past it), which tells
us the X-Wing was rising at 0.39 m/s.</p>
<p>Lastly, we need to know the strength of gravity on Dagobah. Here, I
figure I’m stuck, because while sci-fi fans are obsessive, it’s not like
there’s gonna be a catalog of minor geophysical characteristics for
every planet visited in Star Wars. Right?</p>
<p>Nope. I’ve underestimated the fandom. Wookieepeedia has just such a
catalog, and informs us that the surface gravity on Dagobah is 0.9g.
Combining this with the X-Wing mass and lift rate gives us our peak
power output:</p>
<p>\[\frac{5,600 \mathrm{kg} \times 0.9\mathrm{g} \times 1.4 \text{
meters}}{3.6 \text{ seconds}} = 19.2\mathrm{kW}\]</p>
<p>That’s enough to power a block of suburban homes. It’s also equal to
about 25 horsepower, which is about the power of the motor in the
electric-model Smart Car.</p>

<p>At current electricity prices, Yoda would be worth about $2/hour.</p>
<p>But telekinesis is just one type of Force power. What about that
lightning the Emperor used to zap Luke? The physical nature of it is
never made clear, but Tesla coils that produce <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNJjnz-GdlE">similar
displays</a> draw something
like <a href="http://www.goodchildengineering.net/tesla-coils/drsstc-5-10kw-monster">10
kilowatts</a>—which
would put the Emperor roughly on par with Yoda. (Those Tesla coils use
lots of very short pulses. If the Emperor is sustaining a continuous
arc, as in an arc welder, the power could easily be in the megawatts.)</p>
<p>What about Luke? I examined the scene where he used his nascent Force
powers to yank his lightsaber out of the snow. The numbers are harder to
estimate here, but I went through frame-by-frame and came up with an
estimate of 400 watts for his peak output. This is a fraction of Yoda's
19kW, and was sustained for only a fraction of a second.</p>
<p>So Yoda sounds like our best bet as an energy source. But with world
electricity consumption pushing 2 terawatts, it would take a hundred
million Yodas to meet our demands. All things considered, switching to
Yoda Power probably isn’t worth the trouble—though it would <em>definitely</em>
be green.</p>
